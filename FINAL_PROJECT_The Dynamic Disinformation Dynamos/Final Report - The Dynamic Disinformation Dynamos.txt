Problem Statement
Problem
Reddit, one of the most popular social media platforms, faces significant challenges in combating the spread of disinformation and misinformation through bot accounts. These bots, which can automatically post content and comments, are increasingly being used to manipulate public opinion, polarize discussions, and undermine the integrity of online discourse.
The impact of bot activity on Reddit discussions is particularly evident when examining content related to high-stakes topics such as COVID-19 and political elections. For instance, during the height of the pandemic, numerous bot accounts were identified spreading misinformation about the virus, its origins, and the efficacy of public health measures like masking and vaccination. Similarly, in the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, researchers uncovered networks of bots amplifying partisan content, promoting conspiracy theories, and attempting to suppress voter turnout. These examples underscore the real-world consequences of bot-driven disinformation campaigns on Reddit, as they can shape public opinion, sow confusion, and undermine trust in key institutions.
To address these challenges, it is crucial to develop a deeper understanding of how bots operate on Reddit and how their content and commenting patterns differ across political subreddits. By analyzing the top posts and comments in the conservative, moderate, and liberal subreddits, we can identify the linguistic and behavioral characteristics that distinguish bot-generated content from genuine user interactions.
Objectives and Goals
	As stated, we will analyze three different political subreddits below based on where they stand in their political affiliation. Further information can be seen in Table 1: Subreddit Analysis below. Please note that the subreddits chosen and the comments made on these accounts are in no way representative of our political views.
Table 1: Subreddit Analysis
Subreddit	Username
/r/Conservative/
https://www.reddit.com/user/libbytears0/

/r/moderatepolitics/
https://www.reddit.com/user/djhuh1391/

/r/Liberal/
https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Pomegranate2286/

The goal of this analysis is to understand the different sentiments of each specific subreddit so that we can create three Reddit bots that respectively represents those sentiments. These bots will have the ability to comment on any topic within those respective subreddits and/or similar subreddits without being noticed or banned.
Anticipated Challenges
1.	Account detection and banning:
•	Reddit has algorithms and moderators to detect and ban bot accounts.
•	Certain subreddits, especially r/Conservative, are prone to ban people whose comments and views do not align with the subreddits’ mods and their views.
2.	Karma and account age restrictions:
•	Many subreddits have minimum karma and account age requirements to post or comment. Therefore, we will “roleplay” as a typical follower of that community by posting on related subreddits to accrue karma and avoid suspicions.
3.	Data quality and representativeness:
•	The posts and comments we analyze are not representative of the entire subreddit’s content, as we are focusing on selected top posts only. Therefore, we might have to adjust ChatGPT’s output on a case-by-case basis.
4.	Technical challenges:
•	Developing and deploying bot accounts using Reddit’s API and posting mechanisms require significant technical expertise and money. Therefore, we plan on posting comments and posts manually to avoid costs and any potential bans.

Significance and Relevance
Given the upcoming 2024 presidential election this fall between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, it is important for us to understand the content that we consume online, especially on social media sites such as Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, etc. Although it may often seem that we are engaging with real people on the internet, this is often not the case and is increasingly becoming a problem in our society and in democracy. This project will give an insight into common bot behaviors on Reddit so that we can better understand Redditors in the future, especially for the 2024 presidential election and for understanding what propaganda by bots is and what is actually human.

Analysis Methodology
Data Collection
	Given Reddit’s changes to their API, it is no longer free to scrape Reddit data. Therefore, there were two ways to collect the data. The first is by scraping the data using Python. However, this required complex coding that we were unable to implement. The second method is by using a paid third-party scraper like Apify. From Apify, there were lots of third-party reddit scrapers. We used Reddit Scraper Lite by Gustavo Rudiger to scrape the data as shown in Figure 18: Reddit Scraper Lite and Figure 19: Reddit Scraper Light Crawl.
	The data that we used were taken from the top posts from the past year of each respective subreddit. We manually chose 10 posts based on certain topics and themes centered around US politics, and then took the top 100 comments per post as seen in Table 2: Reddit Posts Crawled. Each post scrapped outputted an excel file as seen in Figure 20: Reddit Scraper Excel Output – Post Example which includes key details such as the comment, number of replies, number of comments, number of upvotes, and the username.

Set Up
1.	Cloned Git Hub Repo.
2.	Installed OpenAI and other necessary packages.
3.	Set up OpenAI’s gpt-4 turbo API.

16. Reddit Field Testing Using AI
16.1. Post Comments on Adjacent Subreddits
1.	Due to not meeting minimum karma requirements, we are unable to post on major political subreddits. Therefore, we posted in adjacent subreddits based on similar subreddits as seen in Figure 4: Similar Subreddits to r/conservative by User Overlap, Figure 5: Similar Subreddits to r/moderatepolitics by User Overlap, and Figure 6: Similar Subreddits to r/liberal by User Overlap.
2.	For the liberal account, we posted on r/TheRightCantMeme. For the moderate account, we posted on r/Libertarian. For the conservative account, we posted on r/Republican. 
3.	Each comment that we generated was based on the personals generated of each individual subreddit. For example, the comments posted on r/TheRightCantMeme was based on the “Liberal” persona. Additionally, the image description from memes in the posts were generated by Chat-GPT and incorporated for the comment generation.

16.4 Have Chat-GPT Generate an Automatic Response Based on the Top Comment of Each Post using the individual Chat-GPT Personalities for Each Subreddit and Post Them
1.	r/TheRightCantMeme
a.	Totally with you on this one. The comparison feels like a major cherry-pick to push a narrative. Detroit's got its issues but using outdated images to make a point does a disservice to the people working hard to revitalize the city. Let's give credit where it's due, yeah?
b.	Lol, yeah, and the catch is making it universal, not just a selective '50s sitcom dream. It's amusing how these ideals align with what many progressives advocate for—fair wages, equality. Funny how things come full circle when you strip down the rhetoric.
c.	Totally relate to this. It’s a narrative spun so tight that it leaves no room for actual facts. People sacrificing their own well-being out of a misplaced sense of pride or principle... Kinda heartbreaking. 
2.	r/Libertarian
a.	LOL, imagine thinking every dollar is just being poured into partying. It's good to see some positive vibes with all the heavy stuff happening, but let's not twist what the aid's really for.
b.	Yeah, the comparison is pretty stark when you think about it. We're over here debating the necessity of our taxes, while in some places, they actually see the benefits in their daily lives. Makes you wonder.
c.	Definitely see where you're coming from. The whole "it'll keep going up" mindset seems so risky with how things are going. Can't just keep betting on GDP growth to bail us out forever.
3.	r/Republican
a.	Yeah, I'm all for doing what's necessary on a farm, but putting this in a book when eyeing a larger political role? Not the smartest move. It's one thing to make tough calls, another to broadcast it like a badge of honor. Yikes indeed.
b.	Yeah, gotta say the judge's ruling sounds a bit medieval to me. The constitution’s not just a suggestion book. Besides, if we start bending on cruel and unusual, where do we draw the line? 
c.	Honestly, the SOTU felt more like a sci-fi show than a political address. Wouldn't surprise me if they had a team offstage ready with a med kit and a power bank for Biden. 
Overall Analysis
Key Findings and Results
Subreddit Size and Engagement: The conservative subreddit emerged as the largest among the three analyzed, boasting the highest number of subscribers, comments, and upvotes. This finding suggests that despite Reddit's overall liberal leaning, conservatives actively seek out and engage in dedicated subreddits that serve as their safe spaces for political discussions. Notably, the engagement per subreddit, measured by the ratio of upvote count to the number of comments per post, was highest in the conservative subreddit, surpassing the liberal subreddit by a factor of 8. This indicates a more tight-knit and active user base within the conservative community.
Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment analysis, conducted with a scale of 0 (conservative), 50 (moderate), and 100 (liberal), revealed intriguing patterns across the subreddits. Surprisingly, all three subreddits exhibited a high frequency of sentiment scores around the neutral value of 50. However, the average sentiment scores aligned with the expected political leanings: the liberal subreddit had the highest average (45-60), followed by the moderate and conservative subreddits. The sentiment distributions further confirmed these tendencies, with the liberal subreddit skewing towards higher scores, the conservative subreddit towards lower scores, and the moderate subreddit falling in between. Interestingly, when examining sentiment distribution by upvote count, all subreddits showed a concentration of highly upvoted comments in the 80-100 range, suggesting that positively charged content resonates across political spectrums.
Keyword Analysis: The keyword analysis highlighted the prominence of certain topics and figures within each subreddit. "Trump" emerged as the most prevalent keyword in both the liberal and moderate subreddits, indicating a strong focus on the former president. Conversely, the conservative subreddit was dominated by keywords like "evidence" and "jury," suggesting a greater emphasis on legal and evidentiary aspects of political discussions. These keyword variations shed light on the distinct priorities and framing employed by each community.
Engagement Patterns: The analysis of upvote count versus posting time revealed optimal engagement windows for each subreddit. Liberal subreddit posts garnered the highest upvotes when made at 10 am and 12 pm, while the moderate subreddit peaked at 10 am and 3 pm. In contrast, the conservative subreddit saw maximum engagement for posts created at 3 pm and 6 pm. Additionally, the day of the week played a role, with Monday being the most engaging for the liberal subreddit, Wednesday for the moderate, and Tuesday for the conservative. However, these patterns could be influenced by the nature and timing of specific posts and breaking news, warranting further analysis to establish definitive trends. There is also a spike in upvotes at 2 am in only the moderate and conservative subreddit, but not the liberal one.
Overall, the relative ease with which we were able to conduct this analysis and generate persona-based comments raises concerns about the ease of misuse of such techniques by malicious actors such as foreign governments, agencies, companies, bad actors, etc.
Broader Implications
The findings of this study have important implications for understanding and combating the spread of disinformation on social media platforms like Reddit. By identifying the distinctive linguistic and behavioral patterns of bot accounts across different political subreddits, this research provides valuable insights for developers seeking to create more effective bot detection algorithms. Platform administrators and moderators can leverage these insights to better identify and remove malicious bot accounts, helping to curb the spread of false or misleading information.

	Text: It gets worse - if that is possible - when you understand how Rudy was thinking about it,

&gt; Giuliani became drunk, and fantasized about
visiting a hotel with Ms. Dunphy, bizarrely saying during a recorded conversation that he would tell the doorman to wait outside with the luggage so that “we do it on the floor in the living room...we don’t even make it to the bedroom. All the clothes come off,” and telling the doorman, **“I need time alone with my girlfriend, with my daughter. With my little girl.” This became part of a pattern in which Giuliani referenced Ms. Dunphy as his “daughter” in the context of sexual activity** and made her extremely uncomfortable.

	Text: Okay, sure, but “god save the queen, man” is so blatantly out of touch to the degree it’s like does he even know where he is in space and time? What could possibly have prompted that sign off other than some sort of sign of dementia? This sort of apologetic reasoning that requires both the caveat of “yes I personally think maybe he’s a *bit* too old” and the deflection of “but trump” while likening Biden to maybe a cute older relative we all can relate to that says silly things, is getting stale. Biden’s only sympathetic quality is that he is a broken old man who’s being pushed to carry on by those around him for whatever reasons they might have. Other than that he’s been just another establishment politician who’s had questionable policies and motivations to put it exceedingly lightly. How is American politics not looked at as obviously a circus at this point?
