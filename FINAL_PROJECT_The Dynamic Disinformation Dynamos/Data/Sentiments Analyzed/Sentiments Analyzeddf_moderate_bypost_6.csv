"The four elements of a willful retention case ([18 USC793(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793)) are:

1. Defendant had unauthorized possession of; access to; control over

&gt; As president, I could have declassified but now I can't. Secret. This is Secret information. 

2. A Document relating to National Defense Information (NDI)

&gt; This was done by the military and given to me.

3. Willfully retained the document

1,2 and 4 are all objective questions. 3 is where intent enters. 

Willfully retained, or ""simple willfulness"", means Trump knew his conduct was illegal. 

Retention can not be due to mistake or inadvertence. It does not require Trump to know exactly how he was breaking the law.  It does not require Trump to believe that the document could harm the US or aide a foreign power (this is only required for retaining or communicating non-physical information.)

Proving the document in question is classified isnt necessary, but can be used as circumstantial evidence, especially when someone is reasonably familiar with the classification system and then handles the documents in an unauthorized way (eg, knowing he has classified information that cant be declassified and is handling them outside a proper storage area.)

Acts of deception to evade detection are also treated as evidence of willfulness.

4. Failed to Deliver the document to an officer of the United States Government entitled to receive it.

The Recording is from a July 2021 Bedminster meeting.
Trump was subpoenaed May 11, 2022. But for someone reasonably familiar with classified documents, knowing you have classified documents held outside a proper storage area, and then not returning them, is enough to fail to deliver the documents.

Just Security has an excellent [Model Prosecution Memo](https://www.scribd.com/document/650130579/Just-Security-Model-Prosecution-Memo-Trump-Classified-Documents-Second-Edition-June-2023#) that gets deep into the legal weeds of the offenses -- eg what the elements and precedents and known facts and potential defenses are.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-09T14:24:58.000Z,comment,t1_jnj7e5r,,,1.0,t3_14549mc,,jnj7e5r,2024-03-31T20:29:35.898Z,,,,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14549mc/exclusive_donald_trump_admits_on_tape_he_didnt/jnj7e5r/,t2_3hs8ujul,pluralofjackinthebox,20.0
"Donald Trump admitted on an audio recording that that he had retained “secret” military information that he had not declassified, according to a transcript obtained by CNN. 

As president, I could have declassified, but now I can’t,” Trump says, according to the transcript.

“Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,” Trump says at one point, referring to a military document about a potential attack on Iran. “This was done by the military and given to me.”

“All sorts of stuff – pages long, look. Wait a minute, let’s see here. I just found, isn’t that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know. Except it is like, highly confidential. Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this.”

"&gt; Trump on tape saying he could have declassified them but didn't should put that particular narrative to rest.

So A) My 2 cents as a lawyer who hasn't dug too deep into any of this, you can't really take what he says at face value. Trump isn't really qualified to say what he legally did or did not do nor whether or not he possesses the power to do something. The only thing it really effects is what his intent was. That's why any competent attorney would tell their client to shut the fuck up when being asked technical questions. It's either for their attorney or a qualified expert to opine on that stuff. 

Which goes to B) Holy shit I think I developed an aneurysm reading his quotes in this article. I'm tired with the flu, but man, that was painful to read.

"Yes, obviously we don't know what was physically happening there when the audio was recorded. But Trump readily admits that he *had* the power to declassified information, as in past tense, and that he was aware that ""this"", whatever he was referencing, remained classified.

"The thing is that, before the Dobbs decision, it was very easy for far away (or even sometimes close up) people to see the abortion positions as empty pandering, or as salad dressing, or as some far off hypothetical thing that's never *actually* going to happen.

"[Can a president secretly declassify information without leaving a written record or telling anyone? That question, according to specialists in the law of government secrecy, is borderline incoherent.  If there is no directive memorializing a decision to declassify information and conveying that decision to the rest of the government, the action would essentially have no consequence. Departments and agencies would continue to consider that information classified and so would continue to treat it as a closely held secret, restricting access to records containing it.  “Hypothetical questions like ‘What if a president thinks to himself that something is declassified? Does that change its status?’ are so speculative that their practical meaning is negligible,” said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy specialist with the Federation of American Scientists.

The best example is that we know Trump had HCS documents, stuff from human sources, from the various unsealed documents. Spies, double agents, etc. The kind of people who can be killed by a foreign government if they're exposed. 

At a minimum, the agency in charge of that human source needs to know both that the information from that agent now needs to be marked differently (otherwise you end up with the absurd situation where Trump is allowed to use the information, but agency staff could still be prosecuted for the same information there protecting as if it were still classified), and they need to get the source to safety now that they're no longer able to stay covert.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-09T15:32:05.000Z,comment,t1_jnjho9h,,,0.0,t1_jnj51xu,,jnjho9h,2024-03-31T20:29:35.898Z,,,,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14549mc/exclusive_donald_trump_admits_on_tape_he_didnt/jnjho9h/,t2_je77v,Bakkster,20.0
"For starters, Trump signed a bill updating some declassification standards, lol. So there are apparently laws on the books to detail the declassification process. But with all things, the nuts and bolts of it are that the president needs to notify the appropriate agency of his declassification efforts. Some things require a review of the material following the president's order to ensure a document doesn't have something the president didn't mean to declassify. Other can happen in ""real time"", but there needs to be an official declaration so it can be logged, because a lot of laws rest on the classification of a document. There are also departments in agencies that independently review documents for re-classification, like JKF assassination files or something.  

In ""real time"" could mean that POTUS saying something in a press conference that was classified. Well, he can legally share whatever he wants, but then the government could work to declassify that specific information to ensure others don't get in trouble for answering follow up questions or dealing with the blow back.

In every instance of the president's powers, the government must be notified in some capacity and changes like declassifications official logged.

"&gt; does not himself have to follow any procedures for declassifying information

Well, depends. If the relevant agencies don't hear about it, they can't perform the steps that actually make the document declassified. It's the same as, for example, the president has plenary power to open national parks, but if he doesn't tell anyone, don't be surprised if some agency allows an oil drilling permit in the area following an earlier order; the national park doesn't magically physically appear in the spot the second the president thinks about it.

Also, if the procedure is nonstandard, the agencies might not interpret it as the real deal and choose not to carry it out. After all, the executive order of the procedure more or less told them ""this is what it will look like when I order declassification"", so by due process they don't really have to interpret anything else as an order.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-09T16:32:17.000Z,comment,t1_jnjr6b3,,,0.0,t1_jnjm5vo,,jnjr6b3,2024-03-31T20:29:35.898Z,,,,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14549mc/exclusive_donald_trump_admits_on_tape_he_didnt/jnjr6b3/,,[deleted],30.0
"I don’t really agree here and I don’t think the law does either.

There are items that are “born secret” meaning they are secret from creation and forever. Everything  related to identify of spies and nuclear energy and weapons falls under this. 

“Not Even the President Can Declassify Nuclear Secrets

there are certain materials that presidents cannot classify and declassify at will. One such category of material is the identity of spies.

Another is nuclear secrets. The Atomic Energy Acts of 1946 and 1954 produced an even stranger category of classified knowledge. Anything related to the production or use of nuclear weapons and nuclear power is inherently classified, and Trump could utter whatever words he pleased yet still be in possession of classified material. Where are our nuclear warheads? What tricks have we developed to make sure they work? This information is “born secret” no matter who produces it. The restrictions on documents of this type are incredibly tight. In the unlikely event that Trump came up with a new way to enrich uranium, and scribbled it on a cocktail napkin poolside at Mar-a-Lago early this year, that napkin would instantly have become a classified document subject to various controls and procedures, and possibly illegal for the former president to possess. Of course if he did so, no prosecutor would pursue him.

"It's the same as ordering any other executive government procedure (such as a disaster response or a military operation or the opening of a national park). You notify the people that carry it out. If you don't notify them about it, then obviously there will be no one to carry out the declassification or to open the national park, so the document won't be declassified and the national park will not be opened. In the case of declassification that would mean the national archives and any agencies that hold those documents, because they'll have to make the documents publicly available and put new stamps on them. There's an official process in place to do it (which has been declared by an executive order), but that mostly exists in order to avoid any confusion among the officials.

In a pinch, you could just send a memo to NARA and it might be treated as a declassification order over there, though then all the other agencies might miss it. And certainly if the NARA employees chose not to carry it out and you took them to court over it, the NARA people would probably win because the White House had previously declared to them that declassification orders look like this and not that (due process applies to government employees as well). There isn't really precedent about any of this, though, because usually presidents have enough of an idea of how to run organizations without confusing their workers and/or don't have to resort to weird sophistry to get out of criminal charges.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-09T16:09:27.000Z,comment,t1_jnjnli0,,,0.0,t1_jnj51xu,,jnjnli0,2024-03-31T20:29:35.898Z,,,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14549mc/exclusive_donald_trump_admits_on_tape_he_didnt/jnjnli0/,,[deleted],25.0

"&gt; Ignoring the case is deciding to give him a pass for this behavior which could have harmed national security.

This is a really important part of this whole situation.  Are we asking ourselves, has the United States of America been harmed as a result of this?  We should also be asking ourselves Why?

Why did he take the documents in the first place?

Why did he only return a portion of the documents initially?

Why didn't he return them when he was asked again?

Why did his lawyers lie about how the documents were stored and about returning all the documents?

Why weren't the documents secured properly to begin with?

There are just so many ""why"" questions, and while I personally hope the answer isn't more serious/sinister than ""incompetence"" - we should all still be extremely concerned.

I agree, though I don't know how to charge him appropriately for that. Like, I don't think he was committing espionage in the sense that all of us define that word - I don't think he was selling secrets or trading them for favors etc. I do think he *intentionally* withheld those documents because his narcissism told him that he could (and should) and that nothing would happen to him. I think he intentionally shared some secrets because he can't help but brag and boast and once again, figured himself immune to consequences. 

Is an espionage charge truly appropriate here? I mean, it technically fits. Do I think he really thought he was risking national security by doing so? I honestly doubt it.
