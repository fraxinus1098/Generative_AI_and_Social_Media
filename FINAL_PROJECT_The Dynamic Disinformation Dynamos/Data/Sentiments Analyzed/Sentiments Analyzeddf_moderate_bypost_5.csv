I'm not sure how you can say it would be a hit to anyone's career or career suicide to endorse Trump when he's the front runner and basically endorsed by almost every single republican in Congress. So that doesn't hold up.

Your argument that people are scared of charges is also mute as Trump himself insulted many people he fired long before Jan6 such as. So apparently even Trump thinks he hires awful people.

So we should not believe any of the comments from people in his administration? We should not be concerned that 82% of his cabinet wouldn't endorse him? His compromising picks were that awful? I mean nothing about this gives any indication whatsoever he has any ability to surround himself with people who are even moderately competent. 

He also shows that if his people are not willing to abandon reality (When they all told him there was no evidence of election fraud) he went out and pulled in Mike Lindell, Sidney Powell, and Rudy Giuliani.",r/moderatepolitics,2024-03-16T00:52:29.000Z,comment,t1_kv2ryjo,,,1.0,t1_kv2pw88,,kv2ryjo,2024-03-31T20:28:20.542Z,,,,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/1bfoju7/pence_says_he_cannot_in_good_conscience_endorse/kv2ryjo/,t2_di6cbdc2,artevandelay55,90.0
"&gt; Republicans had control of the Senate.

The Senate is designed to run on consensus, and it’s easy to gum up the works. See, for example, Politico’s article [*Democrats block dozens of Trump nominees*](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/22/trump-nominees-democrats-block-314775) from 12/22/2017:

&gt;About 100 of President Donald Trump’s nominees have been kicked back to the White House, prolonging an unusually high number of vacancies across his administration and escalating the Senate’s long-running nomination wars.

Or perhaps their 06/08/2020 article, [*The Senate’s record-breaking gridlock under Trump: Filibusters against the president’s nominees have hit historic highs*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/08/senate-record-breaking-gridlocktrump-303811):

&gt;During Trump’s presidency, McConnell and the Senate GOP have held time-sapping roll call votes to break a filibuster and end debate on nominees a whopping 314 times, according to Senate tallies. All previous presidents combined faced 244 roll call votes to advance nominees over a filibuster.

&gt;The practice of blocking or delaying presidential nominees didn’t even begin until Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas was picked to be chief justice of the United States by President Lyndon B. Johnson.

"Your second article ignores a lot of context to make it sound a lot more dramatic than it is, almost to the point where I would say it's highly misleading.

After the threshold for cloture on most nominees was reduced to a simple majority vote in 2013, the Senate started doing cloture votes by default almost every time they considered a nominee, even if there was no filibuster threatened. Prior to 2013, they wouldn't even bring a nominee to the floor for consideration if they knew they didn't have 60 votes for cloture, so the number of cloture votes were far lower even though just as many filibusters were probably happening in the background.",r/moderatepolitics,2024-03-16T16:01:10.000Z,comment,t1_kv5jbx4,,,0.0,t1_kv3ksfo,,kv5jbx4,2024-03-31T20:28:20.542Z,,,,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/1bfoju7/pence_says_he_cannot_in_good_conscience_endorse/kv5jbx4/,t2_bh1qp,Moccus,30.0

"Let’s not forget the story of the January 6th gallows …

“‘So the Traitors Know the Stakes’: The Meaning of the Jan. 6 Gallows

Little is known about how a gallows came to be built near the Capitol, but the motif has become a favorite among right-wing extremists and white supremacists.”

WASHINGTON — Hours after President Donald J. Trump announced a “wild” rally in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, his supporters began discussing building a gallows in front of the Capitol.

“Could be built very quickly with the right plan and the right people bringing pre-cut materials to the site!” a user wrote on a pro-Trump online forum. “Anybody got a blueprint for a standing gallows like that? Who’s with me?!”

Days later, a second user posted a diagram describing the cuts of lumber and rope that would be needed to erect a gallows and fashion a noose. A lengthy planning discussion ensued. A third posted a manual on how to tie a hangman’s knot.

“We will be building a gallows right in front of the Capitol, so the traitors know the stakes,” another user wrote.

A striking array of far-right iconography littered the Capitol during the riot by Mr. Trump’s supporters, such as a Confederate flag, Crusader crosses, an Auschwitz-themed hoodie and “white power” hand gestures. But the gallows erected in front of the Capitol, where rioters chanted “Hang Mike Pence” as they stormed the building looking for the vice president, is one of the most chilling images to emerge from a day of violence and extremism.

It is also one of the bigger unsolved mysteries in the investigation into what happened that day. Seventeen months after the riot, little is known about it. No one has publicly claimed responsibility for erecting the gallows or been charged with setting it up.”
