"Being appointed by Trump was itself a conflict of interest, and that didn’t stop her. In the US, Judges are typically responsible for deciding whether or not to recuse.

I’m not sure to what degree judge shopping is possible in Florida or how it works — like I’m not sure if Trump was just lucky or not in getting Cannon to oversee his case, and to what degree Jack Smith might be able to sideline her.

I think if she does get the case there will be ways to get the case taken away from her probably, a motion for disqualification, appeals to higher courts — but it will really drag things out.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-07T21:13:35.000Z,comment,t1_jnb5fc4,,,2.0,t1_jnb2ol2,,jnb5fc4,2024-03-31T20:27:59.302Z,,,,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/143n58m/prosecutors_ready_to_ask_for_trump_indictment_on/jnb5fc4/,t2_3hs8ujul,pluralofjackinthebox,80.0
"When I made my comment, I wasn’t considering her appointment to be the thing that would disqualify her. My thought was, unless I’m mistaken, that her mishandling of the initial parts of the investigation that earned her a legal slap down from the 11th circuit would disqualify her from having any part of this future trial which is related to the same case. What do you think?

I think judge shopping was what got Cannon involved in the first place, no?

I think you’d be right.

"I really think it’s ultimately Cannon’s responsibility to decide if she’s qualified if she’s handed Trumps case. 

I think there might be a possibility that they might get around her on more technical grounds — although judges are assigned on a random or rotating basis in Florida, sometimes there are “Administrarive Assignments” where judges are assigned to special cases because of their areas of expertise.

"&gt; I really think it’s ultimately Cannon’s responsibility to decide if she’s qualified

Yes, the judiciary has a lot of leeway in deciding if they should recuse themselves. This has historically been rather mundane because the appearance of impropriety undermines the entire system of justice we have in this country. 

With this said, I do not think she would recuse. *Technically,* being  appointed by someone shouldn't be reason enough for recusal, especially since that person is no longer in a position of authority, although her past actions seem fairly suspect from my perspective.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-08T15:01:20.000Z,comment,t1_jnehtbp,,,0.0,t1_jnbr7va,,jnehtbp,2024-03-31T20:27:59.302Z,,,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/143n58m/prosecutors_ready_to_ask_for_trump_indictment_on/jnehtbp/,t2_ih9v4,PM_ME_YOUR_DARKNESS,30.0

"Prosecutors are set to indict former president Donald Trump on obstruction of justice and Espionage Act charges related to his retention of classified information after he left the White House.

Prosecutors will charge him with violating a portion of the US criminal code known as Section 793, which prohibits “gathering, transmitting or losing” any “information respecting the national defence”. His former chief of staff Mark Meadows has already pleaded guilty to lesser crimes in exchange for his testimony against Trump.

That section of US criminal law is written in a way that could encompass Mr Trump’s conduct even if he was authorised to possess the information as president, as he claims, because it states that anyone who “lawfully having possession of, access to, control over, or being entrusted with any document ...relating to the national defence,” and “willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it” can be punished by as many as ten years in prison.

This will be the 2nd indictment against Trump. It is particularly noteworthy that Meadows, a close ally of the former president, is now cooperating with prosecutors against him.

This one truly seemed about as weak as an indictment could get, and being politically motivated is not a stretch.  So, I'm not surprised it ended up helping him.

The GA case to me could change things, and the docs case might.

That being said, I find the approach here pretty interesting.  I read through it a bit, and up until the point where they mention ""and fails to deliver it on demand"" it seems like they could level the same charges against Pence and Biden along with probably countless other elected officials who have mishandled sensitive documents.

That is the difference, they handed them over and he did not, it just seems like a strange bar to set.  To me it kind of reads like ""you can mishandle docs however you want, but when we ask for them back you better give them to us"".

"&gt;This one truly seemed about as weak as an indictment could get, and being politically motivated is not a stretch.

And to be clear, I think the political motivation is more along the lines of ""politicians are not above the law, even former presidents"" rather than ""let's witch hunt republicans"".

&gt;That is the difference, they handed them over and he did not, it just seems like a strange bar to set. To me it kind of reads like ""you can mishandle docs however you want, but when we ask for them back you better give them to us"". When, to me, mishandling to docs should be the bar, not ones willingness to return them.

A few things on this.

One is that Biden was not asked to give documents back. He discovered the documents had been taken on accident and immediately *self reported and cooperated with the investigation*. NARA knew Trump knew that he had documents, including ones with classification markings. By the time they asked for them to be returned, it was was already worse.

From there, DOJ got a subpoena for the documents they knew he had, and knew he didn't return them all (needing a search warrant for the remainder). This is where the potential obstruction charges start.

But mostly it's the self reporting *when it was an accident and no disclosure happened*, that's pretty much the standard for classified documents. If you self report, you get administrative sanctions (escalating write-ups until they revoke your clearance, which Trump is reported to have already had revoked as one of Biden's first acts in office). Criminal charges are reserved for people who hide their mistakes or intentionally leak.

And I’ve heard so many say the party needs to find someone with less drama and chaos around them so they can actually spend their time making changes.

So while maybe some independents are going back to trump, I’ve heard of conservatives and libertarians who are ripe for a person who has less mess, and more ready to make actual change.

"&gt;But isn't that factual that there is a nationwide conspiracy against him

I mean that really depends how you define conspiracy. Is there a broad effort spread across multiple federal and state agencies to investigate Donald Trump? Yes. However, it's not a conspiracy if there's legitimate reason to suspect illegal activity. Prior to running for president, Trump spent 45 years operating in the gray area between legality and illegality and has been found civilly liable on dozens of occasions for millions of dollars in damages. It's not like he was a straight arrow that immediately started being scrutinized when he was elected. The guy has been under some kind of investigation perpetually for almost five decades. It's possible that the world is out to get him, but it's also possible that his comfortable legal gray area is a lot more narrow when he's the president and every word/action he takes is logged.

&gt;The key question has Trump faced opposition that violated prior political norms? I think that is clearly yes.

Oh absolutely he has, and I will definitely agree that a decent chunk of the liberal outrage was completely overblown or based on an outright misrepresentation of facts by the media. But, as you identified, Trump broke basically every precedent and norm in the book. I truly don't think you can effectively compare him to any other president.

&gt;All the NY court cases seem like cases they would never bring against anyone. The first impeachment and Russia seemed made up to me and outside of norms.

The charges Trump was indicted on in NY are pretty standard charges for Bragg's office. Whether those charges have merit is something on which I haven't made up my mind, I'll wait to hear the prosecution's arguments in court.

Regarding the impeachment, though, that one seemed pretty cut-and-dry deserved to me. Whether Trump tried to use congressionally-approved aid to pressure Zelensky into making statements that would help Trump politically wasn't even contested by the Senate Republicans who sat through his first impeachment trial. Their main argument was that since the funds were released by the deadline and Zelensky never made the speech Trump demanded it wasn't a big deal. I personally feel that that conduct is completely disqualifying for the presidency but I know millions disagree with me or think it's par for the course.

As far as the Russia thing goes, I think Trump's 2018 comments in Helsinki, combined with the multiple congressional and independent reports confirming Russia's meddling in the 2016 to help Trump win, justify any and all  suspicion surrounding Trump's relationship to Russia. Those suspicions were inaccurate, but they were not unjustified.

&gt;The classified files though do seem like something Trump is bringing on himself. He could have just followed norms and not created the situation.

I would argue that most of the investigations and legal woes Trump faces were brought on by himself and could have be avoided had he just followed norms. Honestly my biggest issue with Trump is his inability to follow norms. I don't think he was a virulent racist nazi, I just believe that decorum and predictability are extremely important attributes for the most powerful person in the world to have. I also think that the documents investigation and Georgia investigations are examples of him pushing that ""gray area"" a bit too far and landing firmly in the realm of illegality. Trump may be the most slippery person alive but I think he'll have a hard time getting away from these two. I might be wrong though.
