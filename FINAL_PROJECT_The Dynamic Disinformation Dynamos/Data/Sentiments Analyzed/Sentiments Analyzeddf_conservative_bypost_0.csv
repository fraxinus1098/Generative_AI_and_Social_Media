"Thought I’d share terminology as it relates to civil cases (being found **liable**) vs criminal cases (being found **guilty**). Hopefully this helps clarify what the case decision means:

In a civil case, the standard of proof is “by a preponderance of the evidence.” This means that it is *more likely than unlikely* that the defendant is responsible for the harm to the plaintiff. So, the plaintiff must only prove their case by more than 50% of the evidence. If so, the jury must return with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.

In a criminal case, the standard of proof is “beyond a reasonable doubt.” This means that the prosecutor must prove *every single element of the crime* alleged beyond a reasonable doubt. If the prosecutor is unable to do this, then the jury must return with a “not guilty” verdict for the defendant. 

**TLDR:** No idea where this will all lead. Just sharing some information about why the term **liable** is in every headline, as apposed to **guilty**. From a high level overview (specifics aside) being found liable in civil cases has a lower standard than being found guilty in criminal cases.

**Edit:** Punctuation / For those that haven't read the specifics about this **civil trial**: The jury decided that Trump was not liable for rape, but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation.",r/Conservative,2023-05-09T19:38:02.000Z,comment,t1_jjidsgm,,,3.0,t3_13d2zn7,,jjidsgm,2024-03-31T20:04:09.013Z,,,,924,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/13d2zn7/trump_found_liable_of_sexual_abuse_defamation_in/jjidsgm/,t2_3arnxqwq,ewurgy,35.0
"“Would a reasonable person think that something had happened?” would be the question in this civil trial.

In a criminal trial, it would be “is there sufficient evidence to conclude that no one other than the defendant committed the alleged crime?”

That’s not actually accurate in terms of either standard. A criminal trial would require certainty that the crime was committed by that person *beyond a reasonable doubt*. Civil trials can one of two different standards but in this case it was preponderance of the evidence which requires the fact finder to believe it is *more likely than not* that the acts or omissions were committed and that defendant(s) were the responsible parties.,r/Conservative,2023-05-10T00:04:39.000Z,comment,t1_jjjge9f,,,1.0,t1_jjifpc2,,jjjge9f,2024-03-31T20:04:09.013Z,,,,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/13d2zn7/trump_found_liable_of_sexual_abuse_defamation_in/jjjge9f/,t2_biry1,deadzip10,20.0

"&gt; No evidence was presented that showed this event took place. In NY you can now sue someone and claim an evidence-less crime took place 30 years ago, as long as the person you're suing is a disliked public figure.

As the term is used legally, witness testimony is a form of evidence (aside, this is why many news articles that say Trump claims things ""without evidence"" are incorrect). A he said/she said should not be enough for a criminal conviction, but in civil court all you need is for one side to be a little more credible than the other.

Apparently, the jury found the eyewitness testimony including corroboration from her friends of an outcry at the time more credible than Trump's denials. It probably didn't help that even his supporters would admit the guy is a serial liar. Also, the fact that he didn't testify. Or that his ""she's not my type"" defense lost a lot of credibility when he mistook her for his wife in an old photo.

None of us have any idea whether this happened, and the fact that she doesn't even know the year it happened should hurt her credibility.
