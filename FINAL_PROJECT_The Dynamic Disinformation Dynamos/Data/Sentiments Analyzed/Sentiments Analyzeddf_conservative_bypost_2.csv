It's only a short leap to charge him with misuse of classified documents, then move on to espionage charges, and finally they can collect the whole damned family and throw them ALL in jail for receiving money through influence pedaling.

After that they can start knocking on Obama and Clinton's front doors.

"I actually agree with this sentiment that Trump needs to bow out and let someone without all this baggage (even the baggage that's been unfairly foisted upon him) take the lead.  Unfortunately one of the major flaws of most politicians, and especially Trump, is that they have great difficulty putting the needs of the country or even the conservative principles, ahead of personal pride and ego.

Now that said, this banana-republic weaponization of the legal system should not be happening.  So in that sense I hate seeing it happen.",r/Conservative,2023-06-09T15:20:12.000Z,comment,t1_jnjfspq,,,1.0,t1_jniq0mn,,jnjfspq,2024-03-31T20:17:27.040Z,,,,-2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/144p4gr/former_president_trump_says_he_has_been_indicted/jnjfspq/,t2_bl2f3,earl_lemongrab,30.0
