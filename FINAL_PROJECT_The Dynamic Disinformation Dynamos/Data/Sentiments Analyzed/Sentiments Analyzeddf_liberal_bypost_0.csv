"I’m pinching my nose and voting for Biden because I hate him less than Trump. Biden sucks but at least he won’t go all “Won’t someone rid me of this meddlesome priest?” On court clerks and other perceived enemies. At least Biden won’t throw a tantrum and sick a mob on the Capitol and get buried in a million legal charges against him. (I know it isn’t literally a million.) 

At least Joe Biden doesn’t need the vote of the so-called “pro-life” fanatics who passed the laws that resulted in all those horror stories about that 10 year old rape victim who had to leave her state for an abortion or that 14 year old rape victim who was forced to give birth or the women who were forced to give birth to stillborns.

"The question in the post was ""why do democrats still not understand how to push the narrative?"". Biden can go on tv, give speeches around the country (which can be billed to taxpayers as official business, not using campaign funds) and push his narrative, highlight his achievements, and promote his agenda. But he doesn't. The reason he doesn't is because he is old and tired, looks bad on camera, mixes up his words, gets easily confused, etc. like Dianne Feinstein or Mitch McConnell.

"he will start campaigning more when the time comes.   

Trump charges for rallies and sells merch/asks for donations, him 'talking' to voters is him getting paid by his voters.  Trump has nothing else to do other than lawsuits and rallies and lies. 

Biden should not play the same game cause 1. He has a job to do and 2. he would lose at the rally game. I would hope that people smarten up enough to see right through this.

"Why is that CNN is so indifferent. This is probably wrong but sometimes I feel like they secretly love Trump and want him back because of the ratings he brings in from all the shit he talks and things he does. I also blame CNN for making him president. To be fair to FOX (only once) they actually hated and ignored Trump in his run (for the millionth time) while CNN literally had large segments of him in real time and uncut running as if he paid them. 

Either CNN thought it was a cool sideshow for ratings, or they would boost a candidate because Hillary is unstoppable (omg) or Trump paid them secretly for airtime (too big of a conspiracy). 

Either way some people actually like what he said about China, immigration, job loss, corruption etc. I would say even that he was the only one to mention things that neither side would. But the problem was he had no plan, an insane plan (the wall and trade war with China), actually did the opposite (strengthened israels funding when he complained about endless wars and foreign countries taking our taxes) or whatever else Trump does in his insanity",r/Liberal,2023-11-01T10:59:18.000Z,comment,t1_k7cl7uy,,,2.0,t1_k7au2iu,,k7cl7uy,2024-03-31T20:35:48.751Z,,,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/17kxsp6/liberals_start_giving_biden_some_damn_credit/k7cl7uy/,t2_vj9ms8jx,dwehabyahoo,20.0

"There's zero reason to believe that the Trump would do any better in this conflict, I think he'd be way worse.  
First off, Netanyahu is on his team, the far-right. And he's ""fighting"" against Muslim terrorists, and as if Trump cares about civilian casualties, see Ukraine.  
Why would a staunch anti-Muslim be against it? He even moved the US embassy to a controversial location in Jerusalem essentially validifying Israel's claim on it.  
Previously, the administrations had a neutral stance on it.  
He'd be giving up Ukraine. Maybe American bombers would even be bombing Gaza.  
That aside, the party just ratified a christo-fascist speaker. They've made it very clear what they want to achieve with 'project 2025'.

"LMAO that will work out really well with your peers this election. 

His Labor Board is doing really good things but that won't be enough to try and coopt the success of the unions and union organizers. Nearly every other initiative has fallen flat and material conditions haven't changed enough for people to actual feel his policies. 

He's even alienating a fairly large base, particularly in Michigan, but also across the country by his continued support of apartheid.",r/Liberal,2023-11-01T13:57:54.000Z,comment,t1_k7d626x,,,1.0,t1_k7d5cro,,k7d626x,2024-03-31T20:35:48.751Z,,,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/17kxsp6/liberals_start_giving_biden_some_damn_credit/k7d626x/,,[deleted],85.0

"I think the rail workers union would have else to say about him being pro-union. He's only for maintaining the status quo, and that's plain to see with how quiet he's been on social issues during his term. His cosey economy is the same one that's allowed companies to: let their workers die from covid, fire their workers based on sexuality or religion, and pay them starvation wages. I hope he doesn't win next year so he can go smell more young people off the clock rather than on.
