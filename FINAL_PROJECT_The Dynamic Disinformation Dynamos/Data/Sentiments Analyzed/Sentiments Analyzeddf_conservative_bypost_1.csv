"Trumps greatest enemy has always been himself.

Unless there are significant chunks of the audio recording missing / or have been altered, it's a pretty slam dunk case that he:

A. Had documents he knew were classified.

B. Knew that he didn't de-classify them when he was still President.

C. Shared those classified documents to people without clearance or need to know.

The silver lining should be that this leads to reform with outgoing government officials respecting the laws in properly returning government documents.",r/Conservative,2023-06-09T20:15:31.000Z,comment,t1_jnkop98,,,2.0,t3_145clqw,,jnkop98,2024-03-31T20:15:54.232Z,,,,1331,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/145clqw/trump_classified_documents_indictment_made_public/jnkop98/,t2_yqn8l,PrincessRuri,25.0

"For a great breakdown of the entire indictment [Fox realeased an article on it here. They break it down piece by piece.](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicted-federal-counts-special-counsel-jack-smiths-investigation-classified-records) Please if you are a believer in truth and that no one is above the law in our great country at least read their article and decide for yourself.

This is an excerpt that I believe is one of the biggest deals in the indictment. Trump was having an interview with a writer, a publisher and two members of trumps staff about a memoir for Meadows, this interview was recorded with Trumps knowledge.  Trump was the only one who had any clearance.

(edit for context) Thank you to u/fretit who commented an article below that may give some extra context for the below conversation. In it, Milley had claimed that he was worried that Trump was going to go to war with Iran in order to increase his chances of reelection, among other very large claims that would be very detrimental to Trump. This article came out 6 days prior to the below interview.

Once everyone was introduced, Trump stated ""Look what I found, this was Mark Milley's plan of attack, read it and just show...it's interesting.""

During the interview.

Trump: Well, with (Says a Senior Military Official, but it is clearly Mark Milley) -uh, let me see that, I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this just came up. Look. This was him. They presented me this-this is off the record, but-they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. 

Writer: Wow

Trump: We looked at some. This was him. This wasn't done by me, this was him. All sorts of stuff-Pages long, look.

Trump Staffer: Mm.

Trump: Wait a minute, let's see here.

Staffer: (Laughs) Yeah

Trump: I just found this, isn't that amazing? This totally wins me case, you know.

Staffer: Mhm

Trump: Except it is like, **Highly confidential**.

Staffer: Yeah (Laughs)

Trump: Secret, this is secret information. Look, look at this. You attack, and--

(appears that some conversation is missing here)

Trump:This was done by the military and given to me. Uh, I think we can probably, right?

Staffer: I don't know, well we'll have to see. Yeah, We'll have to try to-

Trump: Declassify it.

Staffer: - Figure out a - yeah

Trump: See as president I could have declassified it.

Staffer Yeah. (laughs)

Trump: Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret.

Staffer: Yeah. (laughs) now we have a problem.

"&gt;  I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers, this just came up. Look. This was him.

A lot of people have been wondering and even been baffled about why he insisted on keeping certain documents, even after being asked to return them.  Perhaps this gives a peak into what was going in his mind.  I vaguely recall that he was accused of being a warmonger who wants to attack Iran to stop its growing nuclear program. I think even Milley made the accusation.  Here is an article about it: [You’re Gonna Have a Fucking War”: Mark Milley’s Fight to Stop Trump from Striking Iran](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/youre-gonna-have-a-fucking-war-mark-milleys-fight-to-stop-trump-from-striking-iran).   I also remember similar accusations after he authorized the killing of that Iranian general.

It almost sounds like he wanted to keep those particular documents to deflect those accusations and prove that it was actually all Milley's idea to start a war with Iran.",r/Conservative,2023-06-09T20:11:37.000Z,comment,t1_jnko4dg,,,2.0,t1_jnkf7pr,,jnko4dg,2024-03-31T20:15:54.232Z,,,,348,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/145clqw/trump_classified_documents_indictment_made_public/jnko4dg/,t2_jy2wf,fretit,75.0

I'm not a fan of Trump nor pretty much any politician at this point but showing classified documents to people could very well be within his means as POTUS because of the precedent Obama set with his Executive Order.  


The reality also is that if Donald Trump is considered an active target for this than Hillary Clinton should be immediately indicted for what she did FBI investigation or not as should Biden for what he did.  Obama's stuff was pretty much fine tooth combed over to show that he didn't have anything on him but Hillary should fucking roast for what she did if this is considered ""illegal"" to what Trump is doing now in the indictment eyes.

"I’m, admittedly, not conservatively minded, I believe in honest discourse across the political spectrum, but I am with you 100% about Clinton. If there was a crime committed, no matter where on the spectrum you lie, that individual should be charged.

EDIT: A word.

EDIT #2: I don't know why I can't see or reply to the comments made in reply to my post, even though I receive email notifications that I'm getting replies. Let me clarify my above statement. 

If Hillary Clinton was found guilty of committing a crime, she should be charged. According to the powers that be, that is not the case, so she should not be charged. Getting into the weeds of ""Well she did, but they covered it up etc etc..."" is something I am not qualified to comment on. I have to imagine that there is some idea of justice in this country that makes sure that those that are caught committing an offence are held accountable. 

In this case concerning Donald Trump, he was found guilty and will be charged.

"As I told someone else when Obama was in office he issued an Executive Order that helped expedite declassification and re-classifying and from what I remember reading about it when Obama changed it... it would effectively give any POTUS the ability to declassify anything in their hands or at the very least the person(s) around them would not need as high level of security clearance.

"Allegedly on the tape he said ""I could have declassified this but now i can't"" after sharing it with someone who didn't have clearance. 

I think one of the reasons presidents can declassify anything is for the exact reason of getting advice from advisors as needed but saying it wasn't declassified while sharing it might be legal ammo.
