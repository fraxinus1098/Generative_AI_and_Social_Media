Good luck with that. The so-called moderate Republicans are retiring in droves. The last Republican policy wonk was Paul Ryan, who wasn't very good at it. Concurrently, the chances of a ""better"" Republican winning a primary against a trumpist are approaching zero.

"Well, they fabricate a strawman to play the victim card as well as anyone I've ever seen...

""The theme is back, condescension multiplied. Despite a pandemic that just graphically demonstrated the social contributions of farmers, truckers, train operators, and other “essential workers,” the people working those jobs were demonized during the crisis as murderous horse-paste eaters and insurrectionists. Their chief crimes: protesting lockdowns and school closures that disproportionately affected them, and being consumers of supposed foreign-inspired “misinformation” that led them to refuse appropriate political choices offered them.""

What a complete pile of horseshit...

First of all stimulus from public tax payers saved their asses from losing their jobs forever.

Secondly, hindsight is 20/20, over a million people died and we know 200K of them unnecessarily due to lack of vaccination and masking protocols by a minority of ignorant people. Simple harmless things that could help everyone were ignored to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths. Vaccines were never dangerous and masks flat out worked which is why there was no regular flu season for almost two straight years.

So, never before is it more important to remind people that their freedom is not absolute and must coexist and not intrude on other people's freedoms. You cannot knowingly carry a potentially deadly disease into a public place where you can easily spread it and expect people to respect your decision...that's just not going to happen.

Thirdly, rural America is propped up and paid for by blue cities and states. It is a fact that tax dollars form rich blue cities carry America's economy that flows to rural areas to keep them alive.

"Thank you. I wish I could upvote this 100 times. Too many people lose sight of where natural resources are generated that keep blue cities alive. The country’s wealth is a combination of natural and human resources; each of these areas needs the other, but it’s not really an equal need. While rural areas do benefit from technological advances mostly invented in urban areas, only one of these areas can feed itself or generate the energy necessary to operate the cities and the entire nation. All the money in the world is worthless if there’s not enough food to eat or energy to keep you from freezing to death, and those things just don’t appear out of thin air. The delivery trucks and gas pipelines and electrical transmission lines have an origin. The dismissal of flyover America as only an inconvenient source of insane and dangerous political ideas (and rural areas don’t have a monopoly on the insane politicians…TFG *is* from NYC) only annoys and perpetuates the folks who live in those rural areas, causing some of them to double down on “fuck it…just burn it all down.”

"It’s weird that White rural Trump Supporters are now victims of DEI. Major media outlets are guilty of exclusion racism and bias.

As a rural, White, Trump, supporter myself, who is rather supportive of the DEI policy at my company, I observe media outlets with great amusement. If each day goes by more and more lies are made up about me, and more and more misconceptions about how my brain works are illuminated for the public to examine. You find a outlier and interview them, and then generalize everybody else and say that because you found one animated extremist goofball, their belief is the same belief as all the other conservatives.

If there’s any kind of threat to democracy, it is the media and it’s blatant efforts at inventing things that do not exist. One day it’s going to become such a barrage of lies that it will no longer be considered news, and that will make it eligible for censorship. And then what we call news will be censored information provided to the public at a government level. Right now we are already getting a taste.

Remember people, the goal is to prevent unity it’s to make you hate me and the hope is that I will hate you in return. But I don’t hate people for their beliefs.

"Well, they fabricate a strawman to play the victim card as well as anyone I've ever seen...

""The theme is back, condescension multiplied. Despite a pandemic that just graphically demonstrated the social contributions of farmers, truckers, train operators, and other “essential workers,” the people working those jobs were demonized during the crisis as murderous horse-paste eaters and insurrectionists. Their chief crimes: protesting lockdowns and school closures that disproportionately affected them, and being consumers of supposed foreign-inspired “misinformation” that led them to refuse appropriate political choices offered them.""

What a complete pile of horseshit...

First of all stimulus from public tax payers saved their asses from losing their jobs forever.

Secondly, hindsight is 20/20, over a million people died and we know 200K of them unnecessarily due to lack of vaccination and masking protocols by a minority of ignorant people. Simple harmless things that could help everyone were ignored to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths. Vaccines were never dangerous and masks flat out worked which is why there was no regular flu season for almost two straight years.

So, never before is it more important to remind people that their freedom is not absolute and must coexist and not intrude on other people's freedoms. You cannot knowingly carry a potentially deadly disease into a public place where you can easily spread it and expect people to respect your decision...that's just not going to happen.

Thirdly, rural America is propped up and paid for by blue cities and states. It is a fact that tax dollars form rich blue cities carry America's economy that flows to rural areas to keep them alive.

"While I will agree that of course not every rural American is an inherent racist, i have to disagree that it is just a ‘small vocal minority’. David Duke (founder of the KKK) won 51% of the Louisiana state vote in 1989 when he was elected to the house. That means over half of the people who voted in that election supported the founder of the most racist organization in our nations modern history. Fast forward to 2016 when David duke ran for senate, he still received over 58,000 votes. Even despite this, the unite the right rally and the recent Jan 6 insurrection were not just small crowds, these were thousands upon thousands of people, mostly from rural areas and all inspired by Trump.

"&gt;David Duke (founder of the KKK) won 51% of the Louisiana state vote in 1989 when he was elected to the house.

Wait what? Im not defending David Duke in any way but the KKK was founded *way way* before 1989. Like the end of 1865 over 123 years before 1989 and over 84 years before that pos was even born.

"Thank you. I wish I could upvote this 100 times. Too many people lose sight of where natural resources are generated that keep blue cities alive. The country’s wealth is a combination of natural and human resources; each of these areas needs the other, but it’s not really an equal need. While rural areas do benefit from technological advances mostly invented in urban areas, only one of these areas can feed itself or generate the energy necessary to operate the cities and the entire nation. All the money in the world is worthless if there’s not enough food to eat or energy to keep you from freezing to death, and those things just don’t appear out of thin air. The delivery trucks and gas pipelines and electrical transmission lines have an origin. The dismissal of flyover America as only an inconvenient source of insane and dangerous political ideas (and rural areas don’t have a monopoly on the insane politicians…TFG *is* from NYC) only annoys and perpetuates the folks who live in those rural areas, causing some of them to double down on “fuck it…just burn it all down.” 

- Sincerely, a liberal resident of a major energy producing flyover state that has flipped red in the last 30 years, and who’s also well educated and well traveled and yet chooses to remain in said red state because life really is higher quality here than in a city.",r/Liberal,2024-03-02T22:50:50.000Z,comment,t1_kt2gk3v,,,3.0,t1_kt15es8,,kt2gk3v,2024-03-31T20:39:16.822Z,,,,-2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1b4sr4o/white_rural_trump_supporters_are_a_threat_to/kt2gk3v/,t2_11vvbs,Humulophile,95.0
"1st paragraph 


&gt;In the popular imagination of many Americans, particularly those on the left side of the political spectrum, the typical MAGA supporter is a rural resident who hates Black and Brown people, loathes liberals, loves gods and guns, believes in myriad conspiracy theories, has little faith in democracy, and is willing to use violence to achieve their goals, as thousands did on Jan. 6.




So liberals just imagine every trump supporter as a white person who hates black and brown ppl

"Rural conservatives and liberal urbanites tend to talk over one another.  There should be better discourse and attempts to find shared values.  

But I don't see liberals and Democrats calling for the death of rural conservatives. Nor do liberal urbanites feed themselves a steady diet of hate mongering, rage porn propaganda. But the vast majority of maga ""conservatives"" do so on a regular basis.  It is clear that today's ""conservatives"" are on a fascist path.

I put conservative in quotes because today's version is just neo fascist at this point.  The days of limited government, traditional values, and original ideas are gone. Conservatives today are reactionary and overtly anti-democracy.  The biggest problem is their desire for simple strong-man solutions in a very complex world.
