"I've next to always heard about it, but you're right, it's hard to find video evidence of it, at least on you tube.  

Like here is a clip of a frontline segment on it, but only citing it, not showing video examples of it.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI3I-V03-Ng&amp;t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI3I-V03-Ng&amp;t=6s)  

Here is one thing from 1974 and during his first response there is the slightest occasional stutter or stammer.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIZmZe7fe3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIZmZe7fe3E)

But to be fair it's always reputedly been something most challenging to him when he was younger, and Joe Biden is so old that if you go back before when he was first in Congress, well that's back before VCR cameras, and 8mm home movie cameras were silent films.  Remember, if you didn't get to see the first two Super Bowls on TV like I did as a very small child, then too bad because that was before video tape and instant replays, they didn't ""film"" them with expensive film, so that's it, they were on TV and if you missed the games on live TV then tough, there IS no video recording of the first two Super Bowls.  Even the next day's TV news could only show you photographs and talk about them. 

But that doesn't mean the first two Super Bowls never happened.  Maybe if you can find an old school teacher from one of his old Catholic schools to say it's a big lie and that he never had a problem with stuttering then you've got a conspiracy on your hands, but that's how ancient history works, you've got to go off of what people recount  because we didn't always have smartphones in our pockets.  And people from his childhood days all seem to say it's so, so I believe it.  And I wouldn't take Joe Biden's word on it alone, because he's been known to exaggerate and wing a few things over the years.  Still, enough people from his childhood seem to recount it and say it's so, nobody from his younger days seems to have come forward to dispute it, so I believe it.  

He is old though.  I'd feel better about him as a candidate if he'd replace Kamala Harris with somebody like Dean Phillips.  He's certainly getting there.  

Just as a side story of history; the earlier days of sports explain why Sports Illustrated used to be a much bigger deal than it is today, because that used to be as close as people got to an instant replay of the big touchdown catch.  At least those photos had a higher resolution and were in color, unlike TV.  Everybody used to look at SI, it was everywhere in those days, highly subscribed to, on all the news stands, and at the barbers and in the doctor's office waiting room, SI was just all over the place, everybody saw it and looked at it.

"With McConnell, the issue is the Kentucky Governor is a Democrat. If McConnell leaves office for any reason, he will be replaced by a Democrat until the next special election. 

Feinstein is in a similar position. If she retired early, the Democrat Governor would replace her with another Democrat no problem. But She holds a crucial seat on the Judicial committee. The Republicans (Headed by McConnell) have said if she leaves office for any reason, they are not going to allow the Democrats to replace her on the Judicial committee.

See how easy it is to spin something? Can you not see the connection between American support and Ukrainian success in the battlefield?
