"What's the best case scenario that doesn't involve Trump backing out of the primary? Even if DeSantis wins the nomination who can reasonably believe Trump is going to leave him intact for the general? He is such a narcissist and sore loser he will claim fraud and that the RiNoS!! stole the nomination from him. The same way there are X% of people who are willing to vote for Republicans/like America First policies but won't vote for Trump, there are X/1.5% of people who any Republican needs to show up in a general who won't vote for anyone but Trump if they think Trump got shafted. It seems like DeSantis is going to run and he's got the donors gassing him up to run. But, I wonder if he wouldn't be better off waiting just to not have a loss on his record going into 2028.

"A big problem is that, as with all things, the loudest people set the tone, and the opposition then typecasts everyone in that light.

(of course, same is said for right-leaning subs talking about liberals.) And there are plenty of people that absolutely fit those labels, but it just creates the endless culture wars driven by the obnoxious extremists, and every sane person floating somewhere in the middle just gets dragged around because if we stand up against the garbage on ""our team"" we get exiled completely.
