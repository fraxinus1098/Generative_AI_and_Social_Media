If it really is because of *Dobbs*, then Trump, who has indicated that he wants the GOP to move to a more popular stance on abortion, might actually be the prescription that the GOP is looking for versus someone like Mike Pence, who is very solidly pro-life.

"&gt;  In 2020 Biden won because every single moderate candidate dropped out at exactly the right time.

Probably not

Remember Democrats have proportional allocation of delegates, and even when Biden wasn't in first, he was solidly in second place with some of the most diverse geographic appeal

In a scenario where the other Dems didn't drop out, Bernie probably comes first with 30% or so of the vote, and with his having a strongly anti establishment campaign that is uniquely unsuited to appealing to other candidates, he'd be doomed in the convention.

"Well, it's a bit more nuanced than that. It was an open ended question, ""what word first comes to mind..."". So that 14% is a bit more impactful than if it were a multiple choice. Odds that 14% picked the same set of words from all sets words is interesting.

All that to say, I feel like the headline is justified. Those are the sets of words most commonly used to describe the candidates.

 If it were multiple choice on one good vs one bad set of words, the percentages would have been higher and probably close to party lines on positive vs negative choices.

Don't forget Biden has always had speaking issues. He used to stutter. Trump on the other hand used to speak a lot more normal than the word salad he speaks nowadays.
