"Before blowing up in size and popularity, Antiwork basically had two types of people:

* Those who feel work and a work oriented society are not giving the results it should - i.e. we work far too much for what we get out of it. And though that's easy to disagree with, it's a valid viewpoint. You mention prehistoric hunter-gatherers, but they only worked about four hours every day. The rest of the day was resting and leisure time. They died in childbirth when they were twenty, but still, to some people that might be worth it. Rousseau already argued the same in the 17th century, so, you know, fair enough.
* Those who agree that work is a necessary part of life and dislike that necessity. Just like sometimes I'm watching a movie and I have to get up to pee and I think ""Damn I wish I didn't have to pee"". I acknowledge the necessity of peeing but I still dislike it. Also fair enough, right?

Then the sub got more popular (because it's *fun* to vent about having to work), and a new group arrived:

* Those who don't necessarily dislike work, but dislike shitty managers, terrible working conditions, gold-hoarding billionaires, etc. It's not really in line with being ""anti"" work, and they forced the sub to become far more constructive and moderate than it was (and futilely tried to turn it into a ""movement""), but fair enough. Constructive criticism on society is worthwhile.

But inevitably this new group invited a smaller group, which is the one you described:

* Those who dislike having to work (fair enough) and think society needs to change (fair enough) *to work for them* (not fair!)
