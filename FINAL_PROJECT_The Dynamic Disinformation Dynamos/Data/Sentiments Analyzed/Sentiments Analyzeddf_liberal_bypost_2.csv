"For anyone who claims to be a “hardcore liberal” and considers not voting for Biden, I just have one thing to say: You cannot be a hardcore liberal and hand the election to a man who actively worked to overturn the election, assaults the press and intimidates jurors involved in his numerous cases, these are all antithetical to the foundations of our republic and liberal societies. Look at it this way: you’re not voting for Biden. You’re voting for democracy and constructing a barrier against Fascism.

I never cease to be amazed at how egocentric most people are. They seem to think that the leader of millions of people can only be acceptable if that person represents them in all ways. I am aware that probably only about 6% of the US populations agrees with me on most things. How could I possibly expect a President that is going to just do what I want and ignores the other 94%.

This is why we can’t win all the time like we should. The republicans are complete morons and yet we find ways to open ourselves up to nonsense. Hitler is fascism. Trump is just a kid in a billionaires body and people vote for him because they hate politicians more. Trump is a symptom not the problem. We need to really focus on fixing the economy and it’s inequality and do it from a less extreme perspective so we can clinch all the people on the fence who I don’t blame for not choosing sides. We can’t go more left just because trump is more right.
