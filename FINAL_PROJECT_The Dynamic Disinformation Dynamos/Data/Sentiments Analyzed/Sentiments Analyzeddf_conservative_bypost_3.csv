"You are wrong. Mentally disabled people are treated the same as any other 18 year old regarding sex and consent. Mental incapacity makes the argument that a “condition existing at the time of the [sex act] which prevents a person from understanding the nature or consequences of the act of sexual intercourse. 

The law does not distinguish among the causes of mental incapacity. It applies to mental incapacity “whether that condition is produced by illness, defect, the influence of a substance or from some other cause” — under the law, all these causes are equal.

From Amnesty International (30 seconds of using the internet):

&gt; On the same day of the arrest, the police released the 41-year-old man. The police told lawyers that the 41-year-old was unable to provide consent for sexual conduct due to his “mental status” and therefore a victim, making the alleged offence “aggravated”. However, according to a spokesperson from the Office of the DPP, the “victim was a 41-year-old male living with a disability.” Lawyers said that the police did not provide any evidence to substantiate this assertion.

"(Left-wing LGBT+ voter here) trust me, we were very pissed at headlines like this when this news broke, but we still have reason to be pissed at the law, too. The problem with the Ugandan law isn't that it targets rapists. The problem with the law is that it involves sexual orientation. Rape isn't better or worse just because the gender of the rapist matches or doesn't match their victim. Rape is rape, it is abhorrent no matter who's raping who, and attaching sexual orientation to it is dangerous since it potentially implies otherwise.

Edit to add: ""Aggravated Homosexuality"" in Uganda is specifically defined as sexual relations with someone who is HIV-positive, a child, an elderly person, or a disabled person. Also includes incest. I'm not sure why this couldn't include 'heterosexual assault' since rape of vulnerable groups like this is always abhorrent. 

Also, consentual, not-rape homosexuality is also strictly illegal in Uganda, and I would hope the party of personal liberties and small government would take issue with this as well. **The ""aggravated homosexuality"" law is a charge under the law banning all homosexuality.**

Edit 2: Also wanted to add that the ""aggravated homosexuality"" law is vague enough to apply to consenting adults. For example, most disabled people can consent (taking advantage of someone's disability is abhorrent, but it's also inadvisable to suggest that someone can't have sex just because they have a disability). When you lump in cases of consentual sex with cases of rape, you start to lose the meaning or severity of the latter.

"I never said it doesn't target rapists, and the CNN headline was appalling. The issue is that, as written, it can also be used to target non-rapists.

Rapists are horrific and deserve to be prosecuted. I just want to see the law implemented better.

As written, the ""aggravated homosexuality"" law:

- is a small part of a blanket law banning all homosexuality - consentual or not

- treats some consenting adults (if HIV or disability is involved) to rapists and actual sexual predators, which is especially concerning since the death penalty is a possibility (I'm all for sentencing proven rapists to death, but not if innocent lives could be caught in the crossfire).

Edit to add, here's the law as written: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.parliament.go.ug/sites/default/files/The%2520Anti-Homosexuality%2520Act%252C%25202023.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_sMPP_4SBAxWAL0QIHafiCywQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw11D_zS28rJNT-f5KrOA-p0

The majority of the ""aggravated homosexuality"" law is stuff that I agree should be prosecuted.

"[Here's an article clarifying the difference between mutual funds and private ownership](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-business-investment/fact-check-video-claiming-blackrock-and-vanguard-own-all-the-biggest-corporations-in-the-world-is-missing-context-idUSL2N2WI1K4)

It's mostly tech, which makes sense given that that has been the hottest sector by far in recent years.


Bear in mind that while BR or Vanguard are the holders of the shares via their mutual funds, the funds belong to the shareholders. The fiduciary responsibility of these firms is to their investors, which are overwhelmingly normal folks with 401ks and IRAs. 

They hold significant stakes in many large companies, and their votes do hold some sway, but they don't hold a majority of anything. They certainly don't *own* any large companies. They have influence, yes, but their responsibility is to wield that influence to benefit their investors.

"The fact you’re getting downvoted is wild and really shows how little financial literacy we have in this country.  

Vanguard isn’t “deciding” to invest anywhere for a majority of their assets under management.
