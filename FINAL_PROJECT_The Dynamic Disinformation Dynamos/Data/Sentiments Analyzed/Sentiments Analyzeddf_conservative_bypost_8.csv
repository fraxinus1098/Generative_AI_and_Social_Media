"Wow, looks like the Democrats are also out in full force on this subreddit, for you to get so many downvotes.

I have a more nuanced view. I think our legal system is in general fairly vulnerable political manipulation. At various points in history, probably both parties have benefited from that manipulation, but right now the Democrats are benefiting.

The reasons to not trust the legal system are numerous. First, lawyers are the most corrupt profession on the planet. The world would do better with fewer lawyers. Judges and prosecutors are all lawyers by training.

Second, DAs and judges are political appointees. And in the case of federal judges, they have king like authority, not fearing they will lose their job until they retire or die. Just like a king.

Third, even jury by peers is not without flaw. It works well when the jury is a bunch of random strangers who have no pre-existing opinion about the accused. But even with well known celebrities, we see the system straining. Look at the joke that was the OJ trial or the Amber Heard trial. When you have a celebrity on trial, people walk in with a pre-existing opinion of the defendant, and it’s very hard to get a non-biased outcome. This problem is significantly more pronounced with well known politicians, like a former president, to the point where a fair trial is probably impossible. I wouldn’t trust anyone to separate their views about Trump as President from their opinion of his guilt or innocence for a specific crime.

People put such blind faith in the legal system as an institution, when the reality is its the weakest part of our democracy and easiest to subvert.",r/Conservative,2024-02-07T05:40:33.000Z,comment,t1_kpalu5j,,,1.0,t1_kp73h14,,kpalu5j,2024-03-31T20:23:47.864Z,,,,-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1akcezl/donald_trump_does_not_have_presidential_immunity/kpalu5j/,t2_2lpnt4lv,StarMNF,70.0

"There’s a thing called an impeachment process.

I think if a president is successfully removed with impeachment, THEN they should be criminally liable. And perhaps, they should also be criminally liable for crimes discovered after they are out of office, since there was no opportunity to impeach.

But Trump has already been impeached, and vindicated, for the specific crimes he is being charged with. What is happening right now is in spirit double jeopardy, whether or not it technically meets the legal standard for it — Trump has already been acquitted in the Senate.

And while you might argue that the Senate acquittal was political, isn’t that what’s happening right now with these criminal cases? It seems fairly obvious that most of these criminal cases against Trump are politically motivated, especially when you consider that a number of the cases depend on novel legal theories to criminalize stuff that isn’t normally prosecuted. 

Consistency is the hallmark of a fair legal system. If I dig up a law to prosecute someone for a hypothetical crime that nobody else gets prosecuted for, then something smells rotten.

The point is that any prosecution against Trump for his actions as President has severe risk of being political. The justice system can absolutely be weaponized. This happens in corrupt countries all the time, where one party takes power and punishes the losing party. In fact, allowing that to happen is the road to dictatorship.

But if you have to choose between a democratic political trial (impeachment), and an undemocratic political trial, the former is obviously preferable. It’s going to be political regardless, but it’s best that the decision is made by John Q. Public’s representatives.

This is undoubtedly why the founders came up with the idea of impeachment. Ask yourself why they didn’t instead say that presidents should be first found guilty in criminal court and then removed from office? Why did they create a process for judging a president’s crimes that completely sidesteps the normal court system?

The likely reason is that they did not trust the court system to render a fair verdict in a heavily politicized environment. The concept of double jeopardy also predates the Constitution. While they never explicitly stated that someone who is acquitted in formal impeachment can’t later be criminally prosecuted for the same crimes, I think they would have stated that possibility if they believed it sensible.",r/Conservative,2024-02-07T02:51:03.000Z,comment,t1_kp9zzq4,,,2.0,t1_kp6uvyg,,kp9zzq4,2024-03-31T20:23:47.864Z,,,,-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1akcezl/donald_trump_does_not_have_presidential_immunity/kp9zzq4/,t2_2lpnt4lv,StarMNF,40.0
"Trump's legal team argued something similar wrt impeachment and conviction as prelude to criminal prosecution.

"Common sense, eh? Explain to me how it’s common sense that it can be determined that someone’s crimes are not significant enough to be removed from office, but significant enough to be put in jail.

If a president has done crimes that are serious enough to warrant jail time, then they absolutely should be removed from office. Ergo, if you have a process that determines they don’t need to be removed from office, then they shouldn’t need criminal prosecution either. That’s a simple logical principle called contrapositive.

But the Constitution is completely quiet on this matter. That’s not the same as having no legal merit, because when judges analyze the Constitution, they look at intent, not just what is explicitly written.

My guess is that the Constitution is silent on this, because the authors never thought it necessary because the President already has unlimited pardoning ability. In fact, Impeachment is necessary BECAUSE the President’s pardoning ability gives them an effective way to block criminal prosecution.

To argue that Trump did not have the ability to pardon himself is to go against what is written in the Constitution.

And if you want to still prosecute Trump on the technicality of him not following some specific procedure to pardon himself, well rest assured Trump will be the last President to ever be vulnerable to criminal prosecution. Because every President after Trump will write “I hearby pardon myself” on a memo on Day 1 and keep it as a “Get Out Of Jail” card.

"Yes, because there was no easy way to depose kings. The Constitution lays out an easy way to remove a President, called impeachment.

But that doesn’t mean the founders didn’t realize that a strong leader might sometimes need to make difficult choices that could be viewed as both ethically and legally dubious. They definitely intended for the President to have a lot of power that most people don’t have, and laid out impeachment as a solution if they ever went too far.

And American history reflects this. Consider all the presidents who committed severely worse crimes than Trump is even accused of…

FDR locked up American citizens, completely murdering the Constitution by denying them due process, during WW2.

Andrew Jackson committed literal genocide. If he had lived in modern times, he would have been dragged in front of The Hague and compared to Hitler.

Too long ago? Let’s not forget Bill Clinton. Slam dunk perjury case. People get all wrapped up in the sex scandals that they forget his proven crime was perjury, which is considered a felony last I checked. Like Trump, he was impeached, and acquitted in the Senate along party lines. But surprisingly, nobody ever followed up with a criminal prosecution. And unlike Trump’s case, which requires novel legal theories, perjury cases are fairly straightforward.

Nobody is above the law?

"Yes we have impeachment for Presidents.

And it's not written anywhere that it's ""2024"" for the opinion cited there.

It doesn't matter if it gets correctly applied, there is impeachment.

Kings don't have Congress or the judiciary to impeach them.",r/Conservative,2024-02-06T18:27:00.000Z,comment,t1_kp7n8e9,,,1.0,t1_kp7e0uo,,kp7n8e9,2024-03-31T20:23:47.865Z,,,,-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1akcezl/donald_trump_does_not_have_presidential_immunity/kp7n8e9/,t2_knpyzqa1b,One_Fix5763,35.0

"His defense speaks to his very mindset: 'As President, I can do what I want'.  Multiple members of his administration resigned or were fired for repeatedly telling him the limits of the presidential powers. 

I'm not saying he wants to be a dictator.  I'm saying, he seems incapable of wrapping his head around the job.  He views the presidency as the CEO of the country.
