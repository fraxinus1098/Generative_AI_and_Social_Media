"Unemployment is 3.7%. It was 6.3% when Biden took over from Trump.  
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2023.  
Inflation has gone from 7.1 in November 2022 to 3.5 Novmeber 2023.

"Let's just say there are very good reasons I'm atheist, and those reasons go all the way back to the mid 1980s, and nothing I've seen since has done anything other than reinforce those reasons.

Religion ruins everything, and why I think that is because it's just not relevant anymore, and these days power-hungry types just use it as a tool to control peoples' lives, and as you say, amass wealth -- and as we see now, to attempt to expand that power into secular politics as well. There is no religion I'm aware of, except perhaps Buddhism (which isn't so much of a religion, anyway) and maybe various Pagan practices (which aren't even close to mainstream anyway) that aren't guilty of this anymore.

There might have been a time in the very distant past where religion allowed various peoples to remain cohesive and survive as a people, but modern civilization has largely made the need for it obsolete.

That's my opinion of it all, anyway.",r/Liberal,2024-01-08T18:57:19.000Z,comment,t1_kgxmn2z,,,2.0,t1_kgxk9lz,,kgxmn2z,2024-03-31T20:37:06.441Z,,,,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/191px7d/when_people_complain_about_the_economy_under/kgxmn2z/,t2_859z7bcps,djackson404,80.0
"I am also an atheist and I agree with you about the obsolescence of every religion on planet earth. 

Their historical narratives are counterproductive, their myths are impossible to believe, their practices are superstitious, empty and useless, they indoctrinate and abuse children, and they are dominated by leaders who are grifters, liars, and greedy hypocrites.

Yet, there is a utility, long observed, of a civil institution that teaches moral philosophy, ethics, and fills a need to bridge the gap between the supernatural realm of our unconscious and the immensity and wonder of our universe.

I believe it is possible to create such a civil institution, and call it a religion (why not?), and tell and preserve mythological allegories and parables that are in agreement with everything that we know from science and history. 

It is possible to create “ritual practices” that promote wellness, health, and emotional fulfillment. It is possible to curate creative expressions that offer theatrical catharsis and mark the passage of time and the rites of passage.

There has been a human need for such artistic, and mythological, and ritual, and theatrical expression going back at least 24,000 years. 

There is a reason why humans believe, generally, that sexuality is wicked. But I don’t really care what it is. 

The new religion should be polyamorous, both in the more platonic versions, and in the more erotic versions.

"Inflation cooling doesn't mean prices came down, it means it's increasing at a slower rate than it was before but still increasing (which is always inevitable). It doesn't change the fact the prices increased substantially in a ""booming"" economy over the past 3 years? It doesn't change the fact people have less spending power. Wages didn't keep up so the majority of people feel the squeeze. I don't really know why we are even debating here on this. There is a reason why both liberals and conservatives feel squeezed because of the last few years - its because they have been. It's not just food, it's housing, utilities, healthcare, daycare, clothing, cleaning products, used cars/cars, - all your basic costs have went up substantially. A year of slowing the substantial rising doesn't change any of it. We acknowledge it slowed - which is great, doesn't mean it didn't effect the vast majority of people and put them in a worse off position. Which is why people do not care about a 3% unemployment rate or a growing GDP. None of the statistics you are using will change their position of being worse off than they were pre-pandemic?

"Most of the metrics we use to measure economic health are the ones that benefit businesses and the wealthy, not the ones that actually impact the day-to-day living of ordinary folks.

If we look at the *Consumer Price Index*, which is a sampling of actual prices paid by consumers, prices went way up in 2022 and only slightly less so last year. So people aren't just blind, stupid or not paying attention. The prices they have been paying are way elevated, and until that changes people will have a negative impression of the economy.
