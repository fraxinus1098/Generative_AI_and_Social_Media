"Both.

* Swing state/district representatives legitimately shoot down bills that are too polarizing for their constituents.  Whether they do so out of legitimate sentiment or out of self preservation is irrelevant, because the *effect* is still reasonably accurate state/district representation.
* Partisan ""believers"" get points for supporting the ideals of their (polarized) base, while never actually *achieving* anything, which means that they can continue to campaign on ""I tried to fix &lt;Problem&gt;, but was blocked, reelect me and I'll get it done this time."" 
* Pure politicians (those who *aren't* as polarized as their base) can pretend to be closer to those ideals than they actually are, voting for things they don't *actually* want to pass, because they *know* that the swing votes aren't there.

"regarding your first point, while i’m not naive enough to think politicians are earnest defenders of the public good, if that was true we’d see presidents be much more successful/active in their second term compared to their first. in fact, usually it’s the other way around.

i think the main flaw in your argument lies in the word “we”. “we” do not know how to solve the housing crisis, for example. maybe you know, maybe i know, but the general public certainly doesn’t, and politicians are only as smart as the people that elect them.

personally i tend to believe that we shouldn’t attribute to malice that which is able to be explained by stupidity. “our politicians are bad at their jobs” is a much more likely explanation than “our politicians are puppetmasters who know precisely which buttons to press to maintain the status quo” imo.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-20T18:33:17.000Z,comment,t1_jov35tc,,,1.0,t1_jouzes5,,jov35tc,2024-03-31T20:26:19.491Z,,,,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14e9ngq/biden_says_rich_must_pay_their_share_at_first/jov35tc/,t2_1j9zdlp,zjl539,25.0
"&gt; while i’m not naive enough to think politicians are earnest defenders of the public good, if that was true we’d see presidents be much more successful/active in their second term compared to their first. in fact, usually it’s the other way around.

That sounds like you're agreeing with me.  They're active during their first term, because that makes it *look like* they're worth reelecting, but once they've been reelected, that's generally the end of their political careers, so they have no such ""look good enough to be reelected"" incentive to do anything.

&gt; the general public certainly doesn’t

The entire job of politicians is to figure out how to improve society.  If they aren't learning more than the general populace, they aren't doing their jobs. That's literally the reason (one of them, at least) that we have Representatives rather than Direct Democracy: because the average person doesn't have the time to do all of the research required to make good decisions on any particular topic.

&gt; politicians are only as smart as the people that elect them.

The problem is not *intelligence,* per se, but ignorance.  Unlike intelligence, which is generally immutable, *ignorance* can be be cured.

&gt; “our politicians are puppetmasters who know precisely which buttons to press to maintain the status quo”

Not my argument. 

It's not that they are pushing buttons to maintain the status quo, it's that they have no interest in pushing the buttons that would *change* it.  In other words, they have no incentive to *be* good at their job, but *do* have an incentive to *not* be good at it.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-20T18:58:43.000Z,comment,t1_jov73cl,,,0.0,t1_jov35tc,,jov73cl,2024-03-31T20:26:19.491Z,,,,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14e9ngq/biden_says_rich_must_pay_their_share_at_first/jov73cl/,t2_es1rp,MuaddibMcFly,30.0

I have mortgage, student loans, three kids, property taxes, college and schools to try to save for, and I am sending over $110k a year to the feds. 

Yet I have friends who are worth tens of millions paying a lot less because of investments and write-offs etc.. I even know some wealthy people that qualified for stimulus checks. 

No. The upper middle class gets screwed while the wealthy pay a significant percentage less than their taxes. Working people that make $150-$550k a year are killed by taxes.

If I was for any tax increase it would be a flat tax over certain income regardless of source. And I am talking about $10m+ in yearly income.

?????

Those are taxes/fees owed by the business, not taxes on income for the business owner.  You should not be getting taxed on your personal income for business property taxes, and sales tax is collected on behalf of the state/municipality and does not count towards income.  If a sole proprietorship, you can deduct things like business property taxes, and any sales tax you pay on items purchased for business are included in related deductions.

Revenue =/= taxable income for small businesses, if you are making $400,000 in taxable income as a business owner you are no worse off than any other self-employed individual making $400,000.  You owe $30,400 extra for Medicare/SSI, but that amount is also deductible so at thar marginal rate your extra burden is ~$21,000.

Small businesses don't get hit any harder on taxable income than people do unless you don't take advantage of any of the (extensive) deductions available for businesses.  I do not, and will never, understand invoking small business owners for sympathy points.  Why should your net income of $400,000 get treated any differently than a self-employed consultant's $400,000 of net income?",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-21T15:45:24.000Z,comment,t1_joz270s,,,0.0,t1_jouo7qp,,joz270s,2024-03-31T20:26:19.492Z,,,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14e9ngq/biden_says_rich_must_pay_their_share_at_first/joz270s/,t2_d9ag5,RampancyTW,20.0

"The rich currently pay a higher portion of the country’s federal income tax than the portion of the country’s income that they represent. 

i.e. The top 10% pay 74% of the country’s income taxes despite accounting for only 50% of the country’s income. The top 1% pay 42% of the country’s income taxes despite accounting for only 22% of the country’s income.
