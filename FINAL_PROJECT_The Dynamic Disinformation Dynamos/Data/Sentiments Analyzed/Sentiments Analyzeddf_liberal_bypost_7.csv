"Gee, could it maybe have a little something to do with trump saying what he would do starting his first day in office going after all his political rivals or the fact the gop has put people in places to actually succeed in overthrowing the government if given another chance but most importantly and I cant stress this enough, trump has said he will declare martial law on day one and he has already proven beyond a doubt he would wipe his ass with the Constitution and America. The only things trump did last time in office besides attacking all of America's allies was removing protections for our air and water and giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people on the planet,tried to start a race war and moved the white power back to the top while trying to open protected lands up for drilling. In fact drill baby drill is part of his campaign.

"I too am skeptical that a Trump presidency would be as nightmarish as he and the authors of Project 2025 have expressed. But the *intention* is clear and being spelled out in broad daylight for everyone to see.

The question I find myself asking is, why are liberals so reviled that one would affirmatively vote for Trump knowing such a grave risk exists? Is rolling the dice with the foundational principles of democracy so warranted? Because as I see it conservatives who go to the polls to vote for Trump *must* believe his open hatred for the democratic process is somehow better than letting Biden or another Democrat have another four year term.

"The question I have for you is what would *stop* them doing that stuff if they took power?

Keep in mind, Jan 6 failed in large part because so many key people hesitated or refused to cooperate out of fear of legal consequences. In the years since those consequences have almost entirely failed to arrive. And a second Trump administration wouldn’t be staffed with Bush era republicans to keep the wheels on this time. It would be all loyalists. 

We have historical examples of this sort of thing. The strongest walls in the world fail when they are left unguarded. There are no guards in place on our democracy. We have relied for centuries on tradition and decorum and the idea that voters wouldn’t elect somebody like Trump to keep the wheels on. There is no fallback position. All it takes is him getting the power and then using it. If somebody says “you can’t do that” and he does it anyway that’s the end. 

Civilizations run on the myths in our heads. Once somebody throws out the rules and shatters those myths the whole thing burns. Trump is the man with a hammer and very little to lose. 

If he wins the last resort to restrain his actions would be a military action… and that’s just as bad or worse long term. 

We need to wake up and realize that a fascist movement does not care about decorum, decency, truth, or orderly conduct. They don’t care about law unless they can use it to further their own agenda. The playbook is force YOU to play by the rules while they manipulate those rules at will and ignore them whenever convenient. The only way to keep them in line is the very real threat of physical violence if they refuse to abide by rule of law. And that threat has now been shown to be hollow by the abject failure of the Jan 6 follow-up.

&gt;""freedom is defined by God, not man.""


Is a paraphrasing of something said in Declaration of Independence:  


&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --

"Large portions of project 2025 don't rely on legislation at all, but instead seek to reshape the way the executive branch works. They wouldn't need the support of Congress, but instead would just need a president willing to put it into effect.

A big pillar of project 2025 is that the President has full, unilateral control over the executive branch and can shape it however he sees fit. That includes firing civil servants deemed inadequately loyal, but also shuttering federal agencies to put their authority directly under the control of the president. Since Congress has delegated the power to legislate to those agencies, putting them under direct presidential control would allow the president to legislate without any oversight in those areas.

"It's unlikely that it will directly end our democracy, but it will begin the process of it ending at some point in the coming generations (unless an overhaul of the constitution is implemented in the interim.) Why won't he cause the downfall himself? There are yet too many institutionalists, including in the military, foundations are too strong, the court isn't yet fully corrupted/factionalized, etc. Why will it cause the downfall soon? Because if the precedent of trying to violently take control of the senate does not result in punishment- indeed, results in more power- then eventually someone will try it again, only next time they will be armed. The conversion of the Roman senate into a place of physical control was one of the main signs of the collapse of the Roman Republic.

"That's the worst part. I don't work put or anything, but i know I could body slam Kim Jong un. I don't know about putin, but Kim Jong un, no way I'm not coming out of that fight.
These people are only ""strong"" because they have a whole government of people willing to risk it all for them (lest they lose it all anyways as punishment).

Those people aren't strong in any sense if the word, and I'm half convinced they're almost as stupid as he is too.

What conservatives see in any of the people they look up to is beyond me, because whenever I see the people they idolize and worship, all I see is a bunch of crusty old hasbeens who used to maybe sometimes actually be strong, nowadays they just agree that brown people are the problem.

Maybe they just see themselves in them, like ""hey look, if chuck Norris is fat,old, and racist and he was big strong and cool, maybe I'm still big strong and cool too""

Peaked-in-highschool asses.

Conservatism as I know it has got to be weird for old people, I know age ain't nothing but a number, but come on, at somepoint the ideology that says ""the strong eat the weak"" has gotta reflect on itself and realize, they aren't a member of ""the strong"" anymore (then again most of them never were, just slightly muscley fresh out of highschool, and that's it)",r/Liberal,2024-03-26T02:54:49.000Z,comment,t1_kwl8ac5,,,0.0,t1_kwktxu4,,kwl8ac5,2024-03-31T20:38:31.771Z,,,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bndtnv/do_you_believe_a_trump_victory_this_year_has/kwl8ac5/,t2_2fpg95et,aquacraft2,80.0
