"Oh, [Rudy...](https://eddsa.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/public/650033_2023_Noelle_Dunphy_v_Rudolph_W_Giuliani_et_al_COMPLAINT_10.pdf)

&gt; 53\. **Giuliani gave Ms. Dunphy permission to record her interactions with Giuliani anytime, anywhere, as well as Giuliani’s interactions with others. Giuliani thereafter continually permitted and authorized Ms. Dunphy to make such recordings. He never asked her to stop recording any interaction.** At times, Giuliani pressed “record” himself on Ms. Dunphy’s cell phone to record their conversations.

...

&gt; 8\. Giuliani also abused his position as Ms. Dunphy’s lawyer to pressure her into sex.
In one instance, for example, Giuliani promised Ms. Dunphy that he would give her $300,000 if
she would forgo her legal rights in connection with her pending case and “fuck me like crazy.”
This statement was recorded.

...

&gt; 138\. On February 23, 2019, Giuliani told Ms. Dunphy that he could **“get in trouble with
underage girls” if they were 16 but looked 20.** This conversation was recorded. 

If I am not mistaken, there is a specific word for that.

...

&gt; 213\. Throughout the workday on November 19, 2019, Giuliani insisted that Ms. Dunphy
drink alcohol until she became intoxicated. While Giuliani and Ms. Dunphy were working, **he
initiated aggressive sexual intercourse with Ms. Dunphy. Ms. Dunphy was too intoxicated to
consent to intercourse and did not consent to intercourse.** During this interaction, he made a
comment that he thought of her as his daughter. This comment was recorded.

And I *know* there is a specific word for that. 

...

&gt; 235\. For example, Giuliani made the comments described below, many of which were
recorded:
&gt;&gt;a. Giuliani made derogatory comments about Jewish men and implied that
their penises were inferior due to “natural selection.”

&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt;c. Giuliani said, “Jews want to go through their freaking Passover all the time,
man oh man. Get over the Passover. It was like 3,000 years ago. The red
sea parted, big deal. It’s not the first time that happened.”

&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt;k. Giuliani said to Ms. Dunphy, at various times, in statements that were
recorded:

&gt;&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt;&gt;vi. “Be a slut! Be Rudy’s slut!” 

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;xi. Giuliani stated that he would “get in trouble with underage girls” if
they were 16 but looked 20.

&gt;&gt;&gt;xii. “I think of you as my daughter. Is that weird?”—which Giuliani
said while engaging in sexual contact with Ms. Dunphy.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

There is - and I am not joking - literally a photo from *Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm* in the filing,

&gt; 85\. Ms. Dunphy was frightened. She said she wanted to get dressed, unpack, and settle
in. She asked for privacy. She said she would meet him in the living room when she was ready.
But Giuliani would not leave. **He sat on the bed and pulled down his pants. The following
screenshot from the film Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm depicts Giuliani acting in a similar manner
to how he acted with Ms. Dunphy**:

[A screenshot of the screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/FdE1Won.png).

#&gt; 86\. Giuliani then pulled her head onto his penis, without asking for or obtaining any form of consent. He held her by her hair. It became clear to Ms. Dunphy that there was no way out of giving him oral sex. She did so, against her will.

&gt;87\. Ms. Dunphy was shocked and saddened by what had happened. She did not want
to have any sexual encounter with Giuliani, of any kind.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-05-16T15:35:47.000Z,comment,t1_jkdlclm,,,6.0,t3_13j7m0g,,jkdlclm,2024-03-31T20:23:03.929Z,,,,248,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/13j7m0g/rudy_giuliani_said_he_and_trump_were_selling/jkdlclm/,t2_gynz1,SFepicure,10.0

room...we don’t even make it to the bedroom. All the clothes come off,” and telling the doorman,
**“I need time alone with my girlfriend, with my daughter. With my little girl.” This became part

"Is there though?

The way this stuff is being presented makes me all kinds of skeptical

""Some of these were recordings""- then a list of shit.  Why not just list the stuff that was recorded.

Also, for example, 

&gt;138. On February 23, 2019, Giuliani told Ms. Dunphy that he could “get in trouble with underage girls” if they were 16 but looked 20. This conversation was recorded.

What does any of that actually mean.  First off, the only thing in quotes is ""get in trouble with underage girls""....the if they were about 16 but looked 20 isn't in quotes.  So what did he actually say, was it I don't mess with women who look young because some who look 20 are 16 and then you ""get in trouble with underage girls""

If we have all these recordings of horrible things, lets hear the actual recording.  I will never trust the selective editing of the media.

"I mean, it's pretty believable given what we've seen from him so far (particularly the quick bit that the Borat film caught), but yes, he is innocent until proven guilty. 

That being said, if **any** of those items were recorded it would really, really bad. Have we really fallen so far in our expectations of our leadership that we're entirely unphased by a prominent political leader and trusted advisor to a president literally saying he wants to fuck his daughter? Or that he would pay a subordinate for sex? 

If either of those are true will you unequivocally condemn him? Will you agree that it reflects extremely poorly on Trump for his trusted advisor to be soliciting sex and discussing incest fantasies with his subordinates? 

If there's audio of Rudy discussing selling pardons will you demand an investigation into him and Trump for what is clearly abusing the office of president for personal gain?

The complaint says that he demanded she work in secret and defer receiving payment until Giuliani wrapped up divorce proceedings with his ex-wife, whom he claimed was keeping close tabs on his cash flow.

My guess is she thought she could get something from him, he made promises he would give her things so she’d have sex with him, but when that didn’t pan out she changed course and filed a lawsuit hoping to get the same as Trump’s accuser.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-05-17T02:51:42.000Z,comment,t1_jkgbcga,,,0.0,t1_jkg0rp0,,jkgbcga,2024-03-31T20:23:03.930Z,,,,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/13j7m0g/rudy_giuliani_said_he_and_trump_were_selling/jkgbcga/,t2_ihe07,flompwillow,60.0

"SS:  Noelle Dunphy, who said she worked for Rudy Giuliani as an aide during the last two years of the Trump administration [alleged in a wide-ranging lawsuit that Giuliani](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=ayMPHcCh5eCKqo1g4gB42A==&amp;system=prod), the former president’s personal attorney, discussed selling presidential pardons and detailed plans to overturn the 2020 election results.

Noelle Dunphy said that after Giuliani hired her in January 2019 he sexually assaulted and harassed her, refused to pay her wages and often made ""sexist, racist, and antisemitic remarks,"" adding that she had **recordings of numerous interactions with him.**

According to the lawsuit, Dunphy alleged in her suit that Giuliani talked about presidential pardons. She said Giuliani claimed to have “immunity” and told “her that he was selling pardons for $2 million, which he and President Trump would split.” The lawsuit did not suggest any pardons were sold.

FTA:

&gt;“He told Ms Dunphy that she could refer individuals seeking pardons to him, so long as they did not go through “the normal channels” of the Office of the Pardon Attorney, because correspondence going to that office would be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act,” the suit added.

There's a lot going on in the lawsuit, but IMO the pardon selling is definitely the most egregious, IMO.

"No, but he was when this scheme took place. 

If you have the relevant statute, feel free to post it, but my interpretation of Article II, Section 4 of the US Constitution seems that this would be a political solution, not a criminal one:

“The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, **Bribery**, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”

I'm not a legal scholar, but it seems like a lot of ""norms"" like naked corruption weren't technically illegal, people just didn't do them because it was seen as unseemly and a political liability.

"&gt; 131. Around February 16, 2019, they reviewed Giuliani’s emails with Ukrainian government officials, and again discussed the advisability of registering under FARA. Ms. Dunphy offered to complete the registration for him. Giuliani told her that he was able to break the laws because, he said: “I have immunity.”

&gt; 132. He also asked Ms. Dunphy if she knew anyone in need of a pardon, telling her that he was selling pardons for $2 million, which he and President Trump would split. He told Ms. Dunphy that she could refer individuals seeking pardons to him, so long as they did not go through “the normal channels” of the Office of the Pardon Attorney, because correspondence going to that office would be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

The complaint often mentions when points of fact were either recorded by Ms. Dunphy on audiotape, or if there are corroborating emails and text messages. There doesnt seem to be that here, and its the only mention of pardons. This is one of the more shocking allegations, but it might also be one of the weaker ones.

Of course, the other evidence here can be used to flip Giuliani, or to track down other leads.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-05-16T16:19:43.000Z,comment,t1_jkds7yt,,,2.0,t1_jkdggpr,,jkds7yt,2024-03-31T20:23:03.930Z,,,,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/13j7m0g/rudy_giuliani_said_he_and_trump_were_selling/jkds7yt/,t2_3hs8ujul,pluralofjackinthebox,10.0
"This whole thing brings up some interesting hypotheticals. I mentioned the potential for tax crimes (ie, you get a million bucks for selling a pardon and don’t declare it as income/a gift/something on your taxes) but there’s also thinking ahead: let’s say a party does what Rudy asks, discreetly comes to him and says “yeah, I’ll pay for a pardon”. Rudy and Trump say “ok, no problem.” One would think that it would eventually have to be submitted to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, otherwise they’ll be a giant neon sign of “this one is shady” if it’s granted without going through proper channels and those warrant further scrutiny. They’d at least have to make some sham paperwork to sell the authenticity of it. I wonder if the players involved in this even thought that far ahead, or they would just fly by the seat of their pants and wing it if/when somebody took them up on it.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-05-16T18:33:21.000Z,comment,t1_jkedby8,,,0.0,t1_jkds7yt,,jkedby8,2024-03-31T20:23:03.930Z,,,,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/13j7m0g/rudy_giuliani_said_he_and_trump_were_selling/jkedby8/,t2_15nhfs,camergen,55.0

However, maybe Im cynical, but abuse of power to commit sexual assault doesn’t really shock me any more in general. Im not surprised Giuliani would be this kind of person either.

"We've heard they were selling pardons way before this though. It's nothing, unless she has recordings of this specifically. Even if she does, that doesn't mean it will stick to Trump.

This is frustrating for so many reasons, but right now it's exactly what they are accusing Hunter/Joe Biden of - selling access/favors. The argument goes that Hunter was shady and getting money and what exactly was he selling? Access to his father, even if there is no evidence linking it to Joe. Obviously they are both guilty.

"Also not helping the perception of this case is the huge, huuugggeee variety of acts in this lawsuit.

So there’s that.” It becomes easier for the opposition to paint this woman as “she’s crazy, just listen to the wild accusations here, does that sound like a normal person to you?” I can’t help but think her claims would appear more credible if they were narrower in scope.
