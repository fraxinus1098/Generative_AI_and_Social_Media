"Trump had his guy Bolton disband the White House Pandemic Response Team 6 months before an actual pandemic. They also pulled doctors from China (as you noted) saying ""we can just hire them back if we need them"".

Many quit altogether and some were moved to other areas (CDC, bioterrorism etc)

The real reason he went after the office was that it was created by Obama and had received widespread accolades from the medical and scientific community. There is a video of Obama talking about the creation of the office (2015?) where he makes the comment ""it's not a question *IF* a pandemic will arrive, but *WHEN*"".

There is another clip of Obama discussing the Office where he says something like, ""It (pandemic) will likely come from China and will likely be a flu-like virus"". I've tried to find that clip but I can't locate it.

Pandemics are accepted as inevitable in a world of international travel. MAGAs will of course view the clip as proof that Obama (and Gates and Fauci) had something to do with the creation of the virus.",r/Liberal,2023-10-19T17:12:27.000Z,comment,t1_k5kjmor,,,4.0,t1_k5k9eko,,k5kjmor,2024-03-31T20:36:23.443Z,,,,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/17bkazl/donald_trump_is_going_to_get_someone_killed/k5kjmor/,t2_4e932,Loggerdon,90.0

"Not a surprise but I think it's important for the MSM to get out in front of how dangerous he is instead of pretending he's a normal candidate.
I've been very very angry at The Washington Post and NYT for sweeping Trump's comments under the rug.
It's not just the prosecutions, he's going to start a fucking war and he'll bring down America because nobody is pushing back on the rhetoric.


 If they keep pretending it's just his bullshit in the end we are all going to lose democracy because even if he loses the election he's going to call for a war with General Flynn leading the way with his own militia that he's currently training including children.
If the regular Media doesn't get a move-on they are letting this behavior continue.

"If Trump's supposed ""insurrectionists"" didn't pull off any murders.... These gun lovers that didn't bring any arms to the insurrection? Okay, there were those flag poles, and some explosives found laying around some building nearby. We were told that several people were killed during the insurrection, but a few months later, and now several years later know that claim was false.  I wonder how dumb the public to go along with the insurrection narrative at this point in time, as opposed to seeing it a shameful, moronic riot... someone pooped on Pelosi's desk... gross, stupid, but WOW the insurrection narrative stuck like glue. Defined and redefined.Bill Maher is a true believer.
