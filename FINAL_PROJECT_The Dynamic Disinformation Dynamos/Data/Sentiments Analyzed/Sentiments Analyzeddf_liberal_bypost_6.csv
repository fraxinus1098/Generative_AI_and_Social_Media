"So the other day I was moving and my former neighbor came over to talk to me. He is white, in his 30s with a child. He proceeds to start ranting about how the other neighbor(also white, 30s) who lives in my building, had sent him a link to an article about how America is following certain rules and guidelines to turn into Communist China. Apparently there are 32(?) ""Rules""..and the manifesto lists things from migrants to sex trafficking, gays, transgender, schools, Covid and all the other hits of the far right tinfoil hat universe..both of my former neighbors are massive drug addicts living in squalor and both are Trump supporters. I moved to my new place in a different state and town and down the street from me is what looks like a junkyard but apparently is someone's house and there are MAGA flags, stickers and a "" Trump Won"" flag..around the corner is a trailer with overgrown grass and junk everywhere with a massive ""Trump 2024"" banner hanging off their deck ..I don't understand how these people think that a supposed ""billionaire"" who flies on private jets, is married to a former model, owns golf clubs, and  hotels and properties all over the world, that rich elite, he somehow relates to your plight and understands what you are going through?

"I think one to think about that’s both scary yet hopeful is to remember that the internet did not come into the real main stream until smart phones came out. Yes there was AOL in the late 90’s but this older generation who really had no exposure to internet culture prior to the age of smartphones basically jumped right into the social media eco system without any training on what to believe and not believe on the internet.

I I was about 15 when the internet really took off in the AOL days so I had the luxury of learning stuff like Nigerian prince’s aren’t actually going to leave millions of dollars and that Melissa Joan Heart wasn’t actually nude in that picture my friend sent me, but this older generation is basically still in the learning phase, and because of their age, they are much slower to learn. 

The good news is that millennials and Gen Z are for the most part online savvy and can smell bullshit a mile away.

"The closest I’ve gotten to understand why some people are drawn to Trump is seeing how white nationalism not only coincides with overt racism (what many people get hung up on), but also economic protectionism. When the world economy globalized, and trade deals like NAFTA were negotiated, many blue collar jobs got outsourced to foreign nations with cheap labor (most notoriously China). Immigrants also compete for blue collar jobs, which explains some of the harsh anti-immigrant sentiments. Many towns in the Rust Belt that were built around manufacturing jobs have been hollowed out and left behind. While Republicans (even under Trump) are driven by evangelical fundamentalists and union-busting corporate interests that believe in and act upon trickle down economics, Trump has shown an ability to speak to this populist rage similarly to how Ross Perot did back in the 90’s.

It’s really funny to me to hear people talk about Biden as if he’s Bill Clinton, because they are very different on the issue of protectionism. Where Clinton outsourced jobs with NAFTA, Biden signed into law the Infrastructure and Jobs Investment Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which are designed to create and onshore thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs for the purposes of renovating the nation’s infrastructure and pushing for green initiatives.
