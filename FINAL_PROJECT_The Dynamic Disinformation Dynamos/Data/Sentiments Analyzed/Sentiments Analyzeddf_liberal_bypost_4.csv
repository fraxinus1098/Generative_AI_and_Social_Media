"let me make this abundantly clear.
  

  
in 2021, when it became apparent that trump had lost the election, he insighted an insurrection in an attempt to have his followers overthrow the government and give him another term. attempting to overthrow the government IS treason. all of the rioters who survived that terrible day are being tried for treason and, if there is any justice in the world, they will be convicted.
  

  
now, after everything he has done to this country, trump has the fucking audacity to run for president again as if we would want him back. this man who attempted to overthrow the government when it became quite apparent that he had lost.
  

  
if you vote for him, you will be committing treason. you will be helping someone who attempted to overthrow the government be put back into a position where he could do it again. if he gets reelected, every single person who voted for him will be guilty of treason and, if there was any justice in the world, they would be tried and convicted for it. i don't care how authoritarian i sound. that is the truth of the matter.
  

  
if you really love america as much as you claim to, you will not vote for trump. but, if you really want that bastard back in office, have fun committing treason.",r/Liberal,2023-11-30T02:02:25.000Z,post,t3_1876rrn,False,162.0,,,Liberal,1876rrn,2024-03-31T20:37:11.058Z,self,voting for trump in the upcoming election is treason.,0.83,563,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1876rrn/voting_for_trump_in_the_upcoming_election_is/,t2_e05a8vdo,herequeerandgreat,95.0
"If you live in the United States, you have to know that treason is defined very differently than it is in the rest of the world, specifically Treason is the act of levying war against the united states, or when adhering to our enemies, giving them aid and comfort. The second bit also gets very specific in the form that it requires providing arms to a declared enemy of the state or providing them assistance against the state, but excludes treating the injuries of our enemies or providing them food.

Democracy does not function without the rule of law. Suspending liberties in one's electoral favor is establishing a legal precedent that is eventually suicidal - you inherently give the opposition the right to do the same under their electoral majority.

You've moved the goalposts to ""puts millions of lives at risk."" If you brought it up, you should be able to defend it instead of pose me the question.

"Some of them were tried for and charged with seditious conspiracy by a jury of their peers. And Trump has been indicted for election interference.

""There are 4 central efforts outlined in the indictment regarding Trump and his allies’ efforts to overturn the will of the voters and undermine the results of the 2020 Georgia presidential election.

These include:

Efforts to get Georgia officials to invalidate or nullify the will of Georgia voters, including by “finding” votes that did not exist

The scheme to get 16 fake electors in Georgia to cast fraudulent electoral college votes for Trump, even though Trump did not win the popular vote in the state

Intimidating, harassing, and threatening Georgia elections workers based on false accusations and in an effort to influence their testimony as witnesses

Tampering with county voting machines

All 19 defendants, including Trump, are charged with criminal racketeering under Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which ties together individual criminal acts into a broader criminal network and conspiracy.

The Fulton County, Georgia indictment was brought by a grand jury of everyday citizens convened by DA Fani Willis. DA Willis is a highly respected veteran prosecutor who has been investigating Trump and his allies efforts to meddle with the 2020 election for more than two-and-a-half years. 

The grand jury heard from many witnesses, including state officials who were asked by Trump and his allies to help overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

All eight of them would have cheerfully eaten pepperoni but six of them decided dog shit was worth it to teach the pepperoni lovers that they can’t just get what they want.

"No, that’s not what that means. We remove the dangerous Republicans from office and start taking corrective action against things gerrymandering and the electoral college. Also, Biden is not a fascist. Not sure why you would even think that.

If you consider yourself a liberal why are you so hell bent on guaranteeing Republican wins? Is it strictly for the moral victory? Would you rather the country descend into some dystopian, Christian hellscape where women are relegated to breeding and silence? If so then keep doing what you’re doing. The Republicans have convinced you that your third party vote counts.

How about voting to remove them so things can be codified into law like abortion and LGBTQ rights? Then we can go back to things like symbolic votes. Now is not the time. When Trump gets elected next year, know that you had a hand in making that happen.",r/Liberal,2023-11-30T14:55:03.000Z,comment,t1_kber5ln,,,1.0,t1_kbeo355,,kber5ln,2024-03-31T20:37:11.097Z,,,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1876rrn/voting_for_trump_in_the_upcoming_election_is/kber5ln/,t2_o0ssf,PaulClarkLoadletter,85.0

"I completly understand and agree with the sentiment of the post, but I don’t like the wording of “treason” as a reason not to vote for him. Of course, it would be treason since he tried to overthrow the government, but going against your country isn’t always bad. If you go against your country trying to commit an unjust war or take rights away from marginalized groups, that is a good thing. Of course, in Trump’s case, his treason also happens to be bad, but I dont think calling it “treason” really does it justice. Overthrowing democracy (or rather the attempt to do so) is a better way to say it, as that’s an actual reason he’s bad. Treason just sounds like pounding down on seditious people who went against the government for good causes, whereas for Trump it was the farthest from a good cause. Idk at least that’s how I think about it, feel free to disagree.",r/Liberal,2023-11-30T12:55:46.000Z,comment,t1_kbebh8t,,,0.0,t3_1876rrn,,kbebh8t,2024-03-31T20:37:11.097Z,,,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1876rrn/voting_for_trump_in_the_upcoming_election_is/kbebh8t/,t2_heo1bxdl,aUser138,85.0
