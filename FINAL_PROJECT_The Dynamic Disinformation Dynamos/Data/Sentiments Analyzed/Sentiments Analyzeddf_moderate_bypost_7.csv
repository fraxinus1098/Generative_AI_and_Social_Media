As a former retail banking exec this is mostly correct. Different officers in the bank have different daily limits. Customers can also initiate wires online with differing daily limits based upon the relationship with the bank and other factors. If a customer absolutely has to send a huge wire all at once in one day it can be done.

"House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer released a 65-page memo detailing its investigation of the Biden family. Nowhere in the massive document was there a specific allegation of a crime committed by Biden or any of his relatives.

Comer, when asked if he had evidence directly linking Biden to corruption, was unable to provide any. The memo is full of accusations, but offers no supporting evidence. 

Jamie Raskin, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, slammed Comer for having “failed to provide factual evidence to support his wild accusations about the president. He continues to bombard the public with innuendo, misrepresentations, and outright lies, recycling baseless claims from stories that were debunked years ago.""

"It’s worse than that — Trump’s kids were directly involved in his administration and business in an official capacity. If his kids had been off doing this on their own with no connection to him, it would have been similarly irrelevant political mudslinging and nonsense, but in the case of Trump, his kids were *inextricably intertwined* with all of his dealings as both a businessman and as president. Not only were his kids involved in a staggering number of deals that were orders of magnitude more shady and potentially damaging than anything Hunter was up to, their shadiness is *also* relevant in a way that Hunter’s just *isn’t*.

It is such a rank and blatant display of hypocrisy that the word honestly starts to break down — “gaslighting” is a much more apt description of it.

CNN's [article](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/comer-bank-records-biden-family-members-payments-foreign-entities/index.html) on it is more substantive and goes over the evidence in more greater detail. I found they did a better job than the the New Republic piece which seems to be trying to sell it as a nothingburger out of the gate instead of presenting the evidence and leaving it up to the reader. They're right that there's no incriminating evidence tying Joe yet though they do seem to have uncovered a money laundering scheme that may have benefitted members of his family.

"Well I guess I better vote for the presidential candidate who didn't have family who were enriched indirectly by his position.  

...huh, well, this is awkward.   

Point is, if you have something to nail him with, then do it instead of this ""TOMORROW IS JUDGMENT DAY FOR THE BIDENS"" *tomorrow comes* ""oh my gee this looks quite suspicious. Now we don't have anything, but man, this is so interesting right?"" But they won't. This won't go anywhere other than drip feeds of ""WE GOT HIM THIS TIME"" *time comes* ""man this looks so weird, doesn't it? You should be outraged!"" I'm sure any Democrat could tell you how familiar that is.   

Because if it did, the daggers would come out for any political operative whose family has a position somewhere or received payment. Which is probably like 85% of congress. 

To be fair though, I guess republicans should at least get a few of their own ""WE GOT HIM THIS TIME. Oh. Well. Nevertheless."" Maybe they'll be able to gin up an impeachment from it. Spoilers though, it's much less fun then it seems.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-05-11T12:43:45.000Z,comment,t1_jjqeq7o,,,0.0,t3_13e3aap,,jjqeq7o,2024-03-31T20:31:14.388Z,,,,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/13e3aap/republicans_finally_admit_they_have_no/jjqeq7o/,t2_10sb8k,Iceraptor17,20.0

I always wonder who takes these things seriously. A far left publication telling us what way right people think is almost always wrong. This is like trusting Fox news representations of democrats.

"If that was the extent of the criticism against Thomas, you might have a point. 

I think Biden deserves critique over the actions of his son, but fundamentally he’s an adult who Biden doesn’t have any control over. Again, if he were a dependent things might be different.
