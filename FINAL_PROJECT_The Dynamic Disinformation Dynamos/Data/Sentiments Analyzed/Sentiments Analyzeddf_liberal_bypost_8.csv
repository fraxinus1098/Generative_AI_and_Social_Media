"Spread the word on this, but Brett’s reddit comments here is part a republican strategy trying to dissuade democrats from voting. They enter the conversation as a liberal and say “we don’t have any good candidates so we shouldn’t vote. That will teach them a lesson” when what it’s really doing is helping their side win.

"Biden needs to challenge Trump to a bicycle race every time a reporter says to Joe “polls say you’re too old.” Trump is only 3.5 years younger and couldn’t get on a bike.

"Quite the opposite, actually. If Biden runs fo the general election -- DeSantis will win. And as a trans person with many good trans friends in the United States, that scares me to shit.

The only reason Trump lost in 2020 was because his handling of COVID and debate performances was so godawful even many of his own pary fellows turned against him. That is also why DeSantis has become so popular in conservative circles, because he lacks many of the weaknesses that ruined Trump's campaign performance. It was not so much a Biden win as a Trump loss, all Biden had to do to win was simply sit still and wait for Trump to ruin his own campaign.

But for 2024, this strategy won't work, because more likely than not, DeSantis will be winning the Republican primary. And this is during a time when the American economy is still recovering from the pandemic. Biden will have to sell himself a little harder than he did during 2020, he will actually have to defend the policies he's enacted the last 4 years and make the case for why he should remain president for another 4. And given his age and *visibly* failing health, I don't see that happening.

"Ronald Reagan was 69 when he was elected and I remember the hand wringing that he was too old. Biden seems to know how to pace himself and goes to Delaware or Camp David every weekend possible. 

Biden has surrounded himself with a young and diverse team. They are working and achieving a lot for people, the environment, and our standing in the world. He’s actually the best person we could get right now as the pandemic fades, the economy is improving, and the Ukrainian war is raging. 

I don’t see another Democrat I would feel better about in 2024. As Biden says “Don’t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative,” and that goes for a Democratic rival as well as any Republican.",r/Liberal,2023-04-26T11:43:30.000Z,comment,t1_jhru9ge,,,1.0,t3_12yomgl,,jhru9ge,2024-03-31T20:38:41.296Z,,,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/12yomgl/biden_80_makes_2024_presidential_run_official/jhru9ge/,t2_fag24,markydsade,70.0
He might be 80 but he makes a lot more sense than the other ones who want his job.

"I'll take 4 more of this guy- I've been pretty happy with his current run. Yeah, could be WAY more progressive, but it has still righted the ship that was sinking fast. I feel like he has done a pretty fine job of countering the far right, christian nationalist, and deplorable agenda. Plus, there is this silver lining regarding his age (pun intended):

I want the racist garbage in this country to sweat over the next 5 years that this man stays alive and well- in the event of a health crisis of the president, we would certainly have a hell-of-a-backup in his VP.",r/Liberal,2023-04-26T16:11:28.000Z,comment,t1_jhsufti,,,1.0,t3_12yomgl,,jhsufti,2024-03-31T20:38:41.296Z,,,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/12yomgl/biden_80_makes_2024_presidential_run_official/jhsufti/,t2_9s0gn,Antknee2099,75.0
"&gt;Yeah, could be WAY more progressive, but it has still righted the ship that was sinking fast.

I think Biden is more progressive than his accomplishments show. He is in favor of police reform, voting reform, the social infrastructure bill, better gun control, for example.

Unfortunately, it's the makeup of Congress that stopped those things from happening.",r/Liberal,2023-04-26T22:09:44.000Z,comment,t1_jhudq1x,,,0.0,t1_jhsufti,,jhudq1x,2024-03-31T20:38:41.296Z,,,,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/12yomgl/biden_80_makes_2024_presidential_run_official/jhudq1x/,t2_lj1sz,raistlin65,70.0
