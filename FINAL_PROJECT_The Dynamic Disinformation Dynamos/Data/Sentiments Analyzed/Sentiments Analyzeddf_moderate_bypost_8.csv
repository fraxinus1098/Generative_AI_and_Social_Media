"This is honestly a subject of much interest to me. Consistently throughout history Jews have been blamed and scapegoated again and again - most often to great success. Historically speaking they've been a fairly innocuous people at that. If it weren't for the questionable actions/ideologies of *some* hardcore Zionists in Israel you'd really be hardpressed to point a finger at Jews as a group doing anything questionable. It blows my mind that somehow Jews have been consistently blamed for issues they clearly aren't responsible for, like the downturn of post WWI Germany or any number of controversies Soros gets blamed for and moreso get blamed successfully.

"I think the more nuanced explanation for this is a lot more boring than the theories themselves:

Jewish people make up a disproportionate amount of ""the elite,"" and nearly all conspiracy theories are basically just little guy vs big guy (the inverse being narratively impossible). So they tend to occupy the antagonist role more often. Considering how relatively small the Jewish population is, this is actually pretty notable.

Unfortunately for the anti-semites, it doesn't take any kind of conspiracy to really explain any of that, just the normal dynamics of society being applied:

Firstly, Jewish people trend high on IQ testing. By some studies an entire deviation above the average. Something like ~20% of nobel prize winners are Jewish, while being like ~2% of the population. If I asked you to name as many famous Jewish scientists as you could, you'd probably have 2-3 before I finished this sentence. In the 20's, ivy leagues had to go out of their way to artificially suppress Jewish students from flooding their student body. 

Second, Jewish people also tended for quite awhile to be notably insular, though less so these days. Their communities were tightly knit, and that extended to much of their dealings in the wide world; the money would come into the Jewish community, and then tend to stay there. This is often heralded as a central reason for anti-semitism to be as widespread as it is. 

TLDR; smart people get ahead, and mostly favor their own when they have the option. This is less of a conspiracy, and more just human nature playing out predictably.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-07-15T18:31:23.000Z,comment,t1_js3fwtu,,,2.0,t1_js2jzo9,,js3fwtu,2024-03-31T20:31:55.055Z,,,,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/150dflp/rfk_jr_says_covid_was_ethnically_targeted_to/js3fwtu/,t2_ffrc0,magus678,30.0

"I’m not sure where they got their sample data, but I would have a hard time trusting data from China. I have read that local governments in China systematically underreported the number of covid cases, because of the federal government’s push for zero covid. It would also make sense that a high percentage of reported cases were ones severe enough to have made it to the hospital, and thus to have to be reported.

The consequences of testing positive were fairly extreme in some cases (e.g. being literally locked in your house and not allowed to leave, a serious fire hazard along other things). So anyone who didn’t feel seriously ill may have tried to avoid getting a covid test whose results would be reported to the government. I certainly would have in that situation.

Edit: and yeah, his theory is silly. If anything, perhaps differences in rates of obesity/diabetes/chronic illnesses would account for different covid severity between races.

"We can even look at the difference between European Jews and Middle Eastern Jews. Middle Eastern jews had much less occupation restrictions hisotrically and were allowed to own land, so the population was more rural and less educated than their European Jewish ethnic cousins. European jews were largely disposed of their ability to hold land or hold most regular jobs. So they had to focus on narrow selections of professions which mostly required more education than normal, like lawyer, accountants, bankers, traveling merchants, doctors. European restrictions on Jewry filtered Jews in to professions which would eventually become the professional class which has done so well since the start of modern capitalist wealthy societies. While Middle Eastern Jews did not have that filtering effect in most of the Middle East (yemen was an exception but they were mostly filtered into silversmithing) so they were more or less equally educated to the other locals and did not have overwhelming numbers in banking, doctors, lawyers, etc and were generally worse (and notable Muslims have the same ritual cleaning so the plagues tended to not spare the Jews if it caught the Muslims unlike Europe)

"The Nazis didn't invent the ghetto. They just forced Jews into existing ghettos. The first ghetto was created in Venice in the 1500s. 

Shtetl is just a Yiddish word that means small villages. Many Jews living in Eastern Europe, outside of large cities, lived in these small villages, as they weren't allowed to live in most major cities like Saint Petersburg or Moscow. In cities they were allowed to live in, they generally lived in ghettos. Napoleon actually made it a point to liberate ghettos and destroy their gates as he marched eastward. The ghettos the Nazis created were either made out of former ghettos, or made out of existing Jewish neighborhoods in large cities like Warsaw.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-07-15T17:26:38.000Z,comment,t1_js36ukm,,,0.0,t1_js2so37,,js36ukm,2024-03-31T20:31:55.055Z,,,,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/150dflp/rfk_jr_says_covid_was_ethnically_targeted_to/js36ukm/,t2_3ddv094a,HamburgerEarmuff,35.0

"RFK Jr. has said some controversial things recently at a fundraising dinner. 

&gt;“COVID-19. There is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately,” Kennedy said. “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.”

It seems RFK believes that COVID-19 was crafted in a lab to target specific groups:

&gt;“We do know that the Chinese are spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing ethnic bioweapons and we are developing ethnic bioweapons,” he claimed. “They’re collecting Russian DNA. They’re collecting Chinese DNA so we can target people by race.”

There isn't much to really say but to condemn these comments. They're blatantly false and another classic example of conspiracies against Jewish people. They don't make logical sense either if you think about it longer than a few seconds. If Covid-19 was a bio-weapon, why are the Chinese not targeting Jews? Does it just loop back into the case of Jews run the world and control China? That seems like the logical end point of this conspiracy RFK Jr. is pushing.

Not that RFK Jr. had much of a chance, but is this going to tank any support he might have had? Will he walk back these statements? Is Biden being proved right by not debating him? Where can his campaign go to from here?",r/moderatepolitics,2023-07-15T14:40:40.000Z,comment,t1_js2jx8c,,,7.0,t3_150dflp,,js2jx8c,2024-03-31T20:31:55.055Z,,,,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/150dflp/rfk_jr_says_covid_was_ethnically_targeted_to/js2jx8c/,t2_v87krdwe,HolidaySpiriter,80.0

&gt;“I have never, ever suggested that the Covid-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews,” Kennedy wrote.

But apparently he almost immediately went to the same territory:

&gt;Instead, Kennedy claimed, he had meant to express his belief that the United States and other governments were developing “ethnically targeted bioweapons,” broadly citing a 2021 study on genetic susceptibility to Covid-19 as “proof of concept” that such bioweapons could be created.

So he's not alleging that they *did* use Covid-19 to target people based on ethnicity, he's alleging that they *are* using Covid-19 to develop weapons that can target people based on ethnicity.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-07-15T17:48:08.000Z,comment,t1_js39w71,,,0.0,t1_js2jx8c,,js39w71,2024-03-31T20:31:55.055Z,,,,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/150dflp/rfk_jr_says_covid_was_ethnically_targeted_to/js39w71/,t2_8ae4o,blewpah,90.0

"I never said a debate cant be had. I actually laid out a very old-school format for a debate that I think would work perfectly. However, a verbal discussion is only a good format if both parties argue in good faith, but if one side uses lies and manipulation it shifts the burden of truth to the informed person rather than the liar. This would be especially true if it's a debate moderated by Rogan on a topic like vaccines.

Well researched opinions and counterpoints can take much more than 10 minutes to come up with, but unresearched opinions and lies only take a few seconds. In a real-time debate (or near real-time in your 10 minute response idea) someone like RFK Jr can gish gallop their way to an apparent ""victory"".

“Pro-RFK Jr. Super PAC Has Deep Ties to Marjorie Taylor Greene, George Santos

The Super PAC is just one example of the nominally Democratic candidate running a campaign that's awash in support from backers of Donald Trump

Federal Election Commission filings list Jason D. Boles of RTA Strategy as its treasurer and use RTA’s website and mailing address. In 2022, Greene’s campaign and leadership PAC, Save America Stop Socialism, paid the firm more than $372,000 for work on her 2022 congressional race, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets.

The Georgia-based RTA, founded by political consultant Rick Thompson, also worked for Walker in his failed 2022 Senate race in Georgia. Thompson served as custodian for Walker’s campaign committee and Boles worked as treasurer of the committee, earning the firm roughly $50,000, according to campaign-finance records. More recently, Boles and Thompson have signed on as treasurer and designated agent, respectively, for the embattled Santos after the indicted congressman struggled to find personnel to handle his campaign finances.

It’s not just one MAGAfied Super PAC, however, that’s backing Kennedy’s run against President Biden in the Democratic primary. His bid is awash in support from Donald Trump’s allies in MAGA World, conservative media, and some of the Republican-donor elite. Broadly, they’re hoping Kennedy will make Biden look weak in the primary, hurting his chances against Trump — or whichever candidate emerges from the GOP primary.

MAGA influencers and longtime Trump associates such as Roger Stone have praised Kennedy’s candidacy as a way to “soften Joe Biden up.” Former top Trump political adviser and campaign strategist Steve Bannon also reportedly spent “months” encouraging Kennedy to run in order to energize anti-vaxxers who make up much of Trump’s base, according to CBS News.”
