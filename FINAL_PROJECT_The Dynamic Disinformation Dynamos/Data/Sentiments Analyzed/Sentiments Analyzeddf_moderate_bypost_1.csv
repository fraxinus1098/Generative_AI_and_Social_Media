"I’ve got three kinda related thoughts on the whole situation:

1. Biden is undeniably very old, and is showing his age. I frankly don’t think he’s the dementia riddled, drooling puppet some have made him out to be, but if he’s anything like my great grandma when I saw her last, he doesn’t have to be that far gone for me not to be comfortable with him holding the presidency. Old people have a lot of wisdom and perspective to offer us, but they’re generally a little less sharp. I want someone whose firing on all cylinders for the most important job in the country. 

2. Biden’s always kinda been a gaffe machine. He’s always been known to say kinda wacky or incorrect stuff, and he’s always been a little quick to anger. It’s hard to separate what’s a “normal gaffe” from an “old man moment.” Neither is necessarily good, I think it’s just a point of nuance that’s important to consider.

3. Trump doesn’t have a lot of room to talk. His speaking style is a stream of consciousness, and he says way wackier things all the time. He’s also nearly as old, and I think he’s noticeably older than last time around, much less ten or twenty years ago. We need younger players in politics to take charge.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-18T18:23:06.000Z,comment,t1_jom1rwx,,,21.0,t3_14cqpfi,,jom1rwx,2024-03-31T20:24:24.961Z,,,,898,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14cqpfi/biden_causes_confusion_after_signing_off_speech/jom1rwx/,,[deleted],30.0

"Biden was ahead in the polling average for the entire primary more or less. You may want to pull up the polls again as I think you are misremembering how the primaries went. Claiming every election that didn’t go your way is “rigged” is a dangerous way to view politics. Everyone didn’t all of a sudden drop out to support someone who wasn’t going to be one of the final two. The only way Biden would have lost to one of the other centrist candidates was if they could beat him in the black vote. After South Carolina is was blatantly obvious that wasn’t going to happen, Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out because they had no logical path forward. People claim Warren stayed in purely to ruin Bernie’s chances but there is little evidence that she was even pulling solely Bernie votes. And even if she was, Bloomberg was still in the race pulling votes almost entirely from Biden, a fact that I never see acknowledged.

The others dropped out because it made no sense to have three more moderate Dems split the vote while Sanders ran away with the primary. Sanders never had the majority of the electorate. And it showed once it came down to him and Biden.

The states in the Primary before South Carolina are also primarily lower population white states that aren't great representations of the Democratic electorate.

Look at the graph. He was leading the entire time except for the small period where Bernie had the lead after Nevada for like a week and a half.

I think what irks a lot of people, especially on the right, is that Trump would get called out on those wacky things, and there would be speculation for days about his cognitive abilities.

With Biden, those same outlets seem to be reluctant to even acknowledge that Biden said something wacky, and anyone claiming it was wacky is the fool for thinking it.

Trump had help from the Fox/right-wing media bubble who began calling Covid ""fake"", the vaccine was poison, ivermectin cures Covid, masks became 'face diapers for wussie lib snowflakes', and that deaths were exaggerated, for ex.:

"1) This is undoubtedly true.  Its weird that his one's getting the attention that it has, because its hardly new.  Getting lost on stage, mumbling incoherently, confused statements, his inability to talk about numbers, etc.  Its nothing new.  It also seems generally clear what is aged related and what is the normal sorts of gaffes that he's been famous for for decades.  I personally do think it is dementia, and I find it cruel that his family or the party keep pushing him.  

2) I don't know, classic Biden gaffes like ""you ain't black!"" or his ""joke"" about Indians working in 7/11's are a lot different than confusedly asking where Jackie Walroski was when she had a very high profile death days earlier or calling countries by their wrong names when trying to talk about them or repeatedly calling his VP the President.  

3) Trump recently [came to Biden's defense](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-shockingly-defends-biden-against-ageist-attacks-at-fox-news-town-hall) on the age issue, likely knowing his own age could easily be called into question.

&gt;The quality of the intelligence analysis has also come under scrutiny. The failure to find weapons stocks or active production lines, undermining claims by the October 2002 NIE and both President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell (Document 16, Document 27), has been one particular cause for criticism. Controversy has also centered around specific judgments - in the United States with regard to assessments of Iraq's motives for seeking high-strength aluminum tubes, and in the United Kingdom with respect to the government's claim that Iraq sought to acquire uranium from Africa. Post-war evaluation of captured material, particularly two mobile facilities that the CIA and DIA judged to be biological weapons laboratories, has also been the subject of dispute. (Note 5)
  

  
In addition, members of Congress and Parliament, as well as potential political opponents and outside observers have criticized the use of intelligence by the Bush and Blair administrations. Charges have included outright distortion, selective use of intelligence, and exertion of political pressure to influence the content of intelligence estimates in order to provide support to the decision to go to war with Iraq.

"With speaking (especially if remarks aren’t prepared) most people just can’t form continually coherent sentences without thinking. Your brain has to focus on what you’re saying, while figuring out what you’ll say next which isn’t easy. So most people have some “buffering” go on. Lot of ways to do that like:

- filler words, such as “like”, “ummmm”, or just a string of repetitive adjectives (e.g. big, beautiful, secure wall vs wall)
- pausing and not saying anything
- restating things you’ve said

Trump just throws out a string of adjectives because it gives him time to form his next thought. Obama generally either paused or said “um” when he was speaking. Biden will go off on tangents/stories, and also uses pauses and the occasional filler word.",r/moderatepolitics,2023-06-18T21:08:09.000Z,comment,t1_jomo8gt,,,2.0,t1_jom6trm,,jomo8gt,2024-03-31T20:24:24.962Z,,,,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/14cqpfi/biden_causes_confusion_after_signing_off_speech/jomo8gt/,t2_g9xby,Snlxdd,25.0
