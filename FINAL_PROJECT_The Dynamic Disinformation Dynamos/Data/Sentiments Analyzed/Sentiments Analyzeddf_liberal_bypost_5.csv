"Shouldn't we be shoving it down their throats until they come to reason? I tried asking this on ask liberal and had my posts blocked and even once here.

I'm referring to of course far left and centrists who would normally vote blue, but are refusing to in swing states specifically.  It's like they don't seem to care about Trump, or realize just how worse he will be if they let him win. Not the Trump voters that are impossible to convert. And in 


Reddit is the only place where the average person can reach a large amount of people. But why are even liberal subs refusing to listen?

I'm so sick of the same arguments over and over. Our democracy and American lives are more important than anything else right now. Don't blackmail us with a dictator and hold us literally hostage.

(It's not being a bully to warn about a very real threat, its like saying scientists are bullying you over climate change, the only way to get people to listen is to be aggressive about it)

I have trans family members lives on the line here. 

And I rely on Medicaid/ssi which Republicans want to get rid of, I'm physically disabled and can no longer work due to an injury. It might not be their campaign chopping block promise, but If some of the hard core anti socialist republican congress get their way, it will be. Frankly, I don't know how anyone who relies on it can vote Republican, and I especially can't understand a so called liberal being ok about the risk of  losing it by refusing to vote/vote third party and letting Trump win.

"First thing to say is that it's not a controversial opinion. That doesn't mean everyone is going to adopt it.

Second thing is that regardless of the validity of their answer, you telling everyone to shut up and fuck off if it isn't what you want to hear is at the core of the issue, only it's not just you. 

There are significantly sized populations that while they aren't conservatives have had their concerns and issues ignored for prolonged years. The gap between someone like Trump and someone like Biden is legitimately less than it is for the average person that's getting at least something of their concerns addressed. The promises that their turn will come have been delayed if not forgotten entirely. 

The thing that Democrats need to do an even better job of doing is being the big tent party, not just in comparison to Republicans but in a more fundamental comprehensive way. They need to start listening to these neglected groups and make progress on the topics they care about. The number of votes available to Democrats with this undertaking could be in the millions.

On the other end, Democrats have been beating it into their party members not to do that. Teaching us that blindly following fear mongers will be the end of our country.

Now you want to tell that same party, ""Vote this way, or the world as you know it will end""! That just sets off every red flag we've been built to avoid. You may sway a few Trump supporters, but the Republicans have been playing that game for far too long and their claws are deep. Going that way you'll push away a lot of liberal minded voters.

I agree with u/BAC2Think, make the people feel heard. Show them what they have to gain by supporting us. Stop trying to use Republican tactics to sway them over, and go for the disenfranchised people who tend not to vote.

"Gen-X by the way, which is important, I think, for perspective: I've been around long enough to see how people can be, and how things have changed since I was a kid.

Many people won't take notice of How Bad Things Have Become until it's literally right in their face, directly affecting them -- which all-too-often is way, way too late to do anything about it. It's like ""..oh, well, that's just *those* people over there, *that* won't happen here/to me!"" right up until it does; then they go ""WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE TELL ME THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN!?"" (caps beacause screaming and yelling, literally).

I often refer to the current incarnation of the (fascist!) GOP as a **cancer**, and not just for effect, but because they *are* like a cancer: if you catch it early enough, remove it, treat for it, you'll probably be okay, but if you let it reach Stage-4 because you ignored it, or just didn't notice it, the damage it's done probably is irreversible. They're the cancer, the 'patient' is our Representative Democracy. If they get their way, they'll kill the patient, and all that'll be left is a living incarnation of the cancer. Best estimates from people who understand the socio-political ramifications of this are that it would take *decades*, if *ever*, to restore things back to some semblance of how they were. Meanwhile the U.S. would, I think, be so weak, that the enemies we've accumulated in the world over the last 100 years or so would have an opportunity to swoop in and finish off th U.S., or at least make it so irrelevant that we'd never be a world power ever again -- or worse, as I've said before: we'd *join* our former enemies and become everything the U.S. hates.

I do think you've helped me hit on an important point: there needs to be verbage crafted specifically for the sleepwalking people, words they'll understand, so they know what the consequences of things will be.

"What we should be doing is whatever works for the given situation. The goal has to be about results and not just getting our feelings off our chests or making ourselves feel superior.

For example - if you're talking to someone who agrees about the dangers of a second Trump term but isn't convinced their vote matters then, yes, hammering away might be effective.

OTOH, when dealing with the under informed masses  (or even misinformed Trump voters) I've found it far more productive to look for common ground or slowly walk them through their own views in a non-theatening way (I.e. ""Of course grooming kids is wrong - but why, exactly, do you think that's happening?""). Even if you can't get them to do an ideological 180 a lot of times you can make inroads. 

Like, I just can't respect a hardcore Trump supporter. But if treating them as if I do helps deflate their outrage - even temporarily - that's probably a win (maybe one less political donation, a few days of not sharing conspiracies, and a longshot chance that they actually reflect on what they truly believe). Alternatively, I can point out the hard truths about how absolutely moronic their views are and how their lack of critical thinking has earned them a place amongst the worst fascist sympathizers in history - and put them to go on the defensive which will only further entrench their views.

Just know your audience. If you don't think they're reachable don't waste your time. If you do think you can make even a slight impact then approach it pragmatically. I do think a lot of progressives with good intentions end up making things worse because they let their own frustrations guide their interactions and it ends up strengthening the types of views that we ought to be trying to eradicate.",r/Liberal,2023-12-07T21:41:51.000Z,comment,t1_kcf1a95,,,1.0,t3_18d2cq9,,kcf1a95,2024-03-31T20:37:57.124Z,,,,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/18d2cq9/why_the_hell_is_warning_people_that_they_have_the/kcf1a95/,t2_5q7fk,MrMongoose,35.0

"Because people who are doing harm by their actions (or by failing to act) don’t want to hear it!   Most people want to think that they’re good people, and therefore become fragile at the suggestion that they might be doing harm!  So they try to turn it into something “controversial.”

Reddit is largely left leaning anyway, so you are in effect, preaching to the choir. And most of these people don't like being preached at.

"Read my posts on my profile 

Every major poll since August has been oversampling Republicans and pretending that their rightwing views are the majority of public opinion.

The MSM is gaslighting us. They are doing it for clickbait advertising revenue. In my opinion, it is wire fraud and racketeering and it should be prosecuted. 

Write a letter to the Justice Department and demand prosecution. It’s about all we can do about that, unless you favor naming and shaming the 8 media executives who are committing these crimes.

But in the meantime, focus on getting out the vote and spreading the word about how much better things are since we defeated the pandemic, the global recession and the global inflation that has come in its wake.

Oh believe me they definitely are.  And there's no question in my mind they are pushing things like #abandonBiden to divide the left, and get progressives and muslims not to vote blue. What's sad is they don't understand they are just Russian pawns right now.

"They are telling us what they are going to do, Project 2025, etc.

But instead people complain that the democrats are beating their chest every election saying that “this one” is the most important election of our lives.

So far, that’s true.  Do people not remember dropping the ball on voting for Clinton in 2016?  We will be dealing with the effects of that one for 20-30 years.  So it’s not hyperbole when democrats (and even some  former/Lincoln project-republicans like Liz Cheney) are saying these things.
